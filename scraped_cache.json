Some have initiated early social distancing measures and mandatory shut down of non-essential services, while others have relied heavily on thorough test and trace strategies [1]. There have been variations in the severity of government measures between countries. Among this heterogeneity, it is difficult to quantify the effect of these actions and what may have occurred in the absence of such efforts. On the 25th of March 2020, at 11.59pm, New Zealand entered Alert Level 4 in an attempt to eliminate viral transmission [2]. Alert Level 4 assumes sustained and intensive transmission of COVID-19, making widespread outbreaks likely. The government has implemented a range of urgent measures including: instructing people to stay at home, closure of educational facilities and non-essential facilities (excluding supermarkets, pharmacies, clinics and lifeline utilities), rationing of supplies, requisition of facilities, suspension of international travel, limitation of domestic travel, and major reprioritisation of healthcare services. Australia mounted a similar but slightly less stringent nationwide response on the 29th of March [3]. Widespread social distancing measures were implemented with varying levels of non-essential facility shutdown between country states. We aimed to investigate the effect of government driven social distancing measures in Australia and New Zealand and quantify the potential magnitude of COVID-19 case reduction.\n\nMethods In the absence of randomized controlled data investigating the impact of quarantine measures at the country-level, causal inferences via Bayesian structural time series models may provide a suitable alternative. Our model was trained on both real-world data and simulated statistics to generate a counterfactual model. The counterfactual was defined as the predicted number of daily cases if strict social distancing measures were not implemented by the New Zealand or Australian government. A modified SEIR calculator, utilised in other COVID-19 modelling studies [5], was used to estimate the rate of COVID-19 dissemination through the New Zealand and Australian populations [6]. SEIR predictive parameters inputted into the model were: a population of 4.88 million and 24.99 million (current New Zealand and Australia population respectively), a reproductive number of 3 [7], an incubation period of 5 days [4], an assumed infectious period of 10 days and 1 initial case. The Bayesian model was trained on the pre-period from the 26th of February 2020 to 24th of March 2020 for New Zealand and the 25th of January 2020 to the 28th of March 2020 for Australia. The pre-period represents the time between the first confirmed case of COVID-19 and government measure implementation. Through an iterative process, an estimated projection of new daily cases for the post-period (from 25th of March 2020 for New Zealand and 29th March 2020 for Australia to 12th of April 2020), i.e. the counterfactual, was generated (Fig. 1 ). Model uncertainty is expressed as 95% credibility intervals. Figure 1.

Observed cases in the post-period show an average daily case count of 58 and cumulative case count of 1104 over the total duration. This increased to an average daily case count of 148 (SD 15) and cumulative count of 2821 (SD 277) in the counterfactual. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of average daily cases of 90 (SD 15; 95% CI -120—63) and an absolute reduction in "

        "full_text": "Social distancing measures (SDMs) are community-level interventions that aim to reduce person-to-person contacts in the community. SDMs were a major part of the responses first to contain, then to mitigate, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Common SDMs included limiting the size of gatherings, closing schools and/or workplaces, implementing work-from-home arrangements, or more stringent restrictions such as lockdowns. This systematic review summarized the evidence for the effectiveness of nine SDMs. Almost all of the studies included were observational in nature, which meant that there were intrinsic risks of bias that could have been avoided were conditions randomly assigned to study participants. There were no instances where only one form of SDM had been in place in a particular setting during the study period, making it challenging to estimate the separate effect of each intervention. The more stringent SDMs such as stay-at-home orders, restrictions on mass gatherings and closures were estimated to be most effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Most studies included in this review suggested that combinations of SDMs successfully slowed or even stopped SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community. However, individual effects and optimal combinations of interventions, as well as the optimal timing for particular measures, require further investigation.\n\nLockdowns, also known as stay-at-home orders, were the most restrictive SDM where the majority of the population were required to stay-at-home with exceptions granted only for exercise and essential shopping. The stringency of this measure varied across the world due to the need to balance preventing transmission that could lead to numerous hospitalizations and deaths while also avoiding large contractions of the economy or the breakdown of essential services. Therefore, some stay-at-home orders were targeted at some segments of the community rather than community-wide, for example, allowing construction sites or factories to remain open. Here, we focused on reviewing the effect of SDMs in community settings, including those applied in high-risk settings.\n\nSDMs may be applied to specific community settings where there is thought to be a higher risk of disease transmission or a higher impact of outbreaks than the general community. With the help of rigorous contact tracing in some locations, it was identified early in the COVID-19 pandemic that clusters of cases were occurring in settings that involved close interpersonal interactions or industries that require their employees to work directly with clients or the public [ 3 , 4 ]. Social and dining activities that occur in restaurants, bars and weddings were associated with more secondary cases than households for individuals of the same age [ 5 ]. Many social settings and environments where personal care services are delivered with the removal of face masks may be at higher risk of disease transmission in those settings, especially when they occur in enclosed spaces. As such, SDMs that limited group sizes for dine-in restaurants, reduced the capacity of venues or limited opening hours were implemented. Outbreaks in long-term care facilities were particularly concerning because infections in frail older adults were often more severe than those in younger individuals. SDMs in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic generally took the form of cohorting residents and staff or restricting visitors, where sick or exposed residents were grouped together and/or dedicated staff were assigned to only work within those groups. This is challenging as care homes often rely on agencies to provide staff on an on-call basis due to well-documented pre-existing staffing challenges [ 6 ]. In 2009, it was estimated that up to 60% of nursing homes in the US relied on agency staff [ 7 ]. This reliance meant staff members would commonly work in multiple care homes, which contributed to the introduction of infections in some care homes during the pandemic. A study carried out in the US in 2020 found that the risk of infection in nursing homes increased ninefold if the homes hired staff through agencies [ 8 ].\n\nSocial distancing measures (SDMs) are interventions applied to individuals in the community that aim to reduce transmission by reducing person-to-person contacts or the chance of transmission when contact occurs, regardless of their infection or exposure status. The use of SDMs as a means to reduce community transmission of infectious diseases dates back to the 1918 influenza pandemic when school closures and restrictions on mass gatherings were implemented in the United States (US)—a policy decision that was later estimated to have saved thousands of lives [ 1 , 2 ]. School closures were also implemented during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. However, as infections were generally of mild-to-moderate severity and antiviral treatments and vaccines became quickly available, SDMs were implemented for less tha"

        "full_text": "Abstract Introduction The concept of social isolation is currently understood as a measure of epidemiological containment that aims to reduce the speed of spread of the disease, enabling health services to prepare their resources to cope with the likely increase in demand, while also seeking to provide additional protection to groups considered to be at higher risk. Objective The present narrative review aims to compile and synthesize the literature related to social isolation produced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Method This study is a narrative review of the literature on social isolation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results 73 publications were included for full-text reading and were classified into the following categories: levels of social isolation, economic effects, family relationships, health system, mental health of the population, and use of technology. Conclusions It is necessary to plan an escalation of responses to the consequences of the pandemic, especially in view of the increased demand on the health sector and social services. The negative effects of social isolation can be prevented by public policies that offer a response to the economic recession, maintenance of social work, encouragement of quality care in mental health services, and community support for vulnerable families. Keywords: Coronavirus, COVID-19, pandemic, social distance\n\nIntroduction The COVID-19 pandemic started in December 2019 in Wuhan (China), with the emergence of a specific coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2. Worldwide spread of the virus reached pandemic severity in March 2020, as declared by the World Health Organization. 1 The first confirmed case in Brazil was registered on February 26, 2020, in the state of São Paulo 2 and, since then, the number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 has been increasing daily. Thus, in order to contain the overwhelming dissemination, certain technical safety precautions have been adopted to take a more stringent approach to public health protection. Such containment measures have been adopted in all countries involved 3 , 4 and include mandatory use of face masks, implementation of social distancing, cancellation of events (conferences, sports competitions), strict travel restrictions, closure schools/universities and most of the workplaces (except essential health services, press, food and primary assets). On the other hand, some countries were slow to carry out epidemic control measures, suffering the consequences of vacillation by central authorities. 5 Social isolation includes measures such as avoiding contact with family and friends, preference for home delivery of essential items, and reduction of social coexistence, which when it does take place, should observe a minimum distance of two meters between people. 6 Although social isolation is effective as a public health measure to contain viral spread, in psychological terms it can arouse fears, uncertainties, and despair. 7 , 8 Additionally, the impact on the economy and health systems, changes to family relationships, and migration to unprecedented levels of technology use are all happening simultaneously. The pandemic constitutes an urgent situation and demands a range of quick and effective responses from people. Therefore, rapid and systematic efforts are being made in research and clinical settings, mainly in the academic environment and on the so-called “front line”, as demonstrated by the increasing numbers of publications on the subject over recent months. One of the goals of these efforts is to employ different methods to understand the effects of this new external situation on the internal situation, while other targets of investigation include the emergence or worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Prompt dissemination of the findings should contribute knowledge on how to better care for people in general. 9 Against this background, this study aims to review the literature related to social isolation produced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. It is expected that analysis of this scientific production and its synthesis in this article will provide a concise and well-founded source to be read by professionals involved in the care of people in isolation.\n\nMethod This study is a narrative review of the literature on social isolation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptors “pandemic”, “COVID-19” and “social isolation” were used to search the CAPES Periódicos (a Brazilian database), PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar databases. All studies published during 2020 in Portuguese or English up to May 31, 2020 were included in the analysis, in addition to brief communications and theoretical reflections. After reading the search results, three publications that did not mention social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded.

Moreover, these associations were strongest for those highest in paranoia. Furthermore, we show that these patterns are not specific to 5G conspiratorial beliefs: General conspiracy mentality was positively associated with justification and willingness for general violence, an effect mediated by heightened state anger, especially for those most paranoid in the case of justification of violence.

Several enabling technologies are currently being used as key strategies in creating improvements and responses to the difficulties created by the pandemic and blockchain is one of these solution proposals. Within this scenario, this work aims to study and analyze how the blockchain technology can help in the struggle against the COVID-19 pandemic through a systematic review of the literature. Although the study is limited by the moment when the crisis is still in progress, the results show that it is clear that the adoption of the blockchain can effectively help in the fight against the coronavirus, considering that the main features of the blockchain can support the successful implementation of many use cases. This paper has the role of assisting academics and professionals in identifying the application focus of the blockchain, as well as showing the main opportunities and challenges and the relevance of the subject to the current context of the pandemic.\n\nSection 2 of this paper presents the methodology and the data treatment approach. Section 3 illustrates the results of the systematic review. Section 4 shows the findings and discussion, and Sect. 5 concludes the study.\n\nIdentifying the countries that have produced more and published the most solutions to combat COVID-19;\n\nWithin this scenario, the objective of this study was to make a systematic analysis of the implementation and/or use of the blockchain technology applied in the struggle against the pandemic, in diverse segments. The proposal was to answer the following question through the systematic review of the literature:\n\nBlockchain is gaining increasingly prominence due to its wide applications in various sectors of life. Seeing its utility, several companies and authorities around the world have started to use blockchain to develop solutions that can help to fight COVID-19 [ 14 ]. Clinical trial management, medical supply chain, user privacy protection, data aggregation, contact tracing, donation tracking and outbreak tracking are some mainly use cases of blockchain for COVID-19 [ 15 ].\n\nAs [ 12 ] shows, blockchain is broadly classified into three types: public, private and consortium. Public blockchain is the one that anyone can effectively participate in the network, private blockchain is a restricted network which only authorized participants can take part in [ 13 ] and in the consortium blockchain, the right to read Blockchain can be public or restricted to participants only. Moreover, the consortium blockchains are considered partially decentralized in contrast to the private Blockchains [ 12 ].\n\nBlockchain is an electronic cryptographic ledger that operates on a decentralized network model, instead of storing all information in a single database as in traditional cloud-based applications, the information is distributed and synchronized across all nodes in the network [ 8 ]. The blocks (set of transactions) in the network of the blocking chain are checked by the most of the nodes. Hash values can be incorporated into a storage chain format to verify that stored data is tampered with to ensure data integrity. The digital signature is used to verify the actual identities of the providers and receivers of data in the stored transactions. Additionally, the consensus mechanism is designed to involve all computer nodes, thus reducing the potential risks of data manipulation by minority attackers. After validation, the block is added to the chain shared by all nodes in a network [ 9 – 11 ].\n\nAccording to Tan et al. [ 6 ] blockchain technology is one of the many disruptive technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution that will inevitably change the way people live and work. In a research made by Kritikos [ 7 ], the blockchain was considered one of the 10 most recommended technologies to combat COVID-19.\n\nSome authors even discuss the use of these technologies in an integrated way to fight COVID-19, such as the collaboration of blockchain and multi-robot and multi-drones in order to optimize a End-to-End chain, monitoring and detecting important aspects of the pandemic, including social distance and body temperature, and delivering medical supplies [ 4 , 5 ].\n\nTechnological advances as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), internet of things (IoT), blockchain, robotics, 5G, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, cloud and edge computing and big data are one of the key strengths of the current era that may help the world to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19, creating intelligent emergency strategies and improving public health response to the pandemic [ 3 ].\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost all countries and has had a significant effect on the human lives and economical activities. Manufacturing operations, supply chain and logistics are facing serious disruptions [ 1 ],"

        "full_text": "Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, in 2019, is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. It is now accepted that the wild fauna, probably bats, constitute the initial reservoir of the virus, but little is known about the role pets can play in the spread of the disease in human communities, knowing the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect some domestic animals. In this cross-sectional study, we tested the antibody response in a cluster of 21 domestic pets (9 cats and 12 dogs) living in close contact with their owners (belonging to a veterinary community of 20 students) in which two students tested positive for COVID-19 and several others (n = 11/18) consecutively showed clinical signs (fever, cough, anosmia, etc.) compatible with COVID-19 infection. Although a few pets presented many clinical signs indicative for a coronavirus infection, no antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in their blood one month after the index case was reported, using an immunoprecipitation assay. These original data can serve a better evaluation of the host range of SARS-CoV-2 in natural environment exposure conditions. Keywords: COVID-19 epidemiology, Outbreak, Self-isolation, Feline, Canine, Luciferase immunoprecipitation system, LIPS\n\n1. Introduction SARS-CoV-2 infection has presented unprecedented challenges related to viral disease control and prevention worldwide. While the emergence of the virus is now well-documented, important questions regarding the transmissibility of the disease among human populations remain to be answered. SARS-CoV-2 might infect animals [1], including dogs, cats, ferrets [[2], [3], [4]] or minks [5]. Therefore, the hypothesis that small domestic animals could serve as intermediate or amplification hosts of the virus needs to be further addressed in a One Health approach [6,7]. To increase the knowledge regarding transmission rates in circumstances of contamination that ensure efficient human-to-human transmission, we have investigated the infection status of dogs and cats living in close proximity with a cluster of veterinary students who developed COVID-19 symptoms in Winter 2019–2020, i.e. during the initial phase of the first wave of the pandemic in France.\n\n2. Methods We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of domestic cats (n = 9) and dogs (n = 12) living in close contact with a cluster of French veterinary students, their owners (n = 18), whose median age was 23 years (21–28 years). 14/18 students lived in university residences with common traffic areas and daily outdoor activities to allow animals, especially dogs, to relieve themselves in spaces that were shared by all animals. The other four students lived outside the residence, with reduced contact during lockdown, except for one student who lived with a roommate. All 18 students had contact with at least one sick person within three weeks prior sampling and 11 of them developed symptoms compatible with COVID-19 between February 25th and March 18th, 2020. The symptoms were mainly cough, with or without fever. Headaches, dyspnea and dizziness were reported for one case. Among symptomatic students, two were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The other nine symptomatic patients were not tested in accordance with French regulations that, at the time of sampling, did not request to test all patients in such clusters. Other owners (7/18) were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. All of the owners were in the close vicinity of their pets, e.g. living in the same room – of 12 to 17 square meters - and sharing the same bed (8/8 of cats' owners and 4/12 of dog's owners); accepting face/hand licking (6/8 and 11/12 of cats' and dogs' owners, respectively). All cats were domestic European Shorthair cats. Dogs included in the sampled panel were either cross-bred (n = 6) or purebred individuals from the Labrador Retriever, Shetland Sheepdog, Belgian Malinois and White Swiss Shepherd breeds (n = 6). The average age of these sampled adult animals was 3.3 years for cats (min: 6 months; max: 6.5 years) and 2.7 years for dogs (min: 4 months; max: 8 years). Small pets were free of clinical signs, except some respiratory or digestive signs reported for three cats, independently. Sera from this per-epidemic cohort of pets (hereafter named “pets epidemic”, n = 21) were freshly prepared from blood collected on March 25th, one month after the index case. A panel of biobanked sera was also obtained from a second cohort (named “pets pre-epidemic” n = 62), composed of animals sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic - between October 2015 and October 2018, containing 55 dogs from 32 popular breeds and seven cats including five European Shorthair, one Turkish Angora and one Devon rex.

However, alternatives to in vivo experiments, such as immortalized cell lines, primary respiratory epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface, stem/progenitor cell-derived organoids, or tissue explants, have also been used for isolation of SARS-CoV-2, investigation of cytopathic effects, and pathogen-host interactions. Moreover, initial proof-of-concept studies for testing therapeutic agents can be performed with these tools, showing that animal-sparing cell culture methods could significantly reduce the need for animal models in the future, following the 3R principles of replace, reduce, and refine. So far, only few studies using animal-derived primary cells or tissues have been conducted in SARS-CoV-2 research, although natural infection has been shown to occur in several animal species. Therefore, the need for in-depth investigations on possible interspecies transmission routes and differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is urgent. This review gives an overview of studies employing alternative culture systems like primary cell cultures, tissue explants, or organoids for investigations of the pathophysiology and reverse zoonotic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in animals. In addition, future possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 research in animals, including previously neglected methods like the use of precision-cut lung slices, will be outlined."

        "full_text": "Abstract Simple Summary Human activities, such as changing the environmental landscape or developing animal-related tourist attractions and zoos, have greatly increased the interactions between humans and animals. Due to this increase in direct contact between humans and animals, the risk of transmission of infections called zoonoses, meaning originating in animals, has increased. We aim to review how human activities have driven zoonoses and why it is so important to study this topic in order to help develop preventative measures against further zoonotic infections in the public. Abstract As humans expand their territories across more and more regions of the planet, activities such as deforestation, urbanization, tourism, wildlife exploitation, and climate change can have drastic consequences for animal movements and animal–human interactions. These events, especially climate change, can also affect the arthropod vectors that are associated with the animals in these scenarios. As the COVID-19 pandemic and other various significant outbreaks throughout the centuries have demonstrated, when animal patterns and human interactions change, so does the exposure of humans to zoonotic pathogens potentially carried by wildlife. With approximately 60% of emerging human pathogens and around 75% of all emerging infectious diseases being categorized as zoonotic, it is of great importance to examine the impact of human activities on the prevalence and transmission of these infectious agents. A better understanding of the impact of human-related factors on zoonotic disease transmission and prevalence can help drive the preventative measures and containment policies necessary to improve public health. Keywords: zoonoses, emerging, climate change, urbanization, deforestation, wildlife exploitation\n\n1. Introduction Human activities, such as urbanization, deforestation, wildlife exploitation, and tourism, as well as the global climate changes that have occurred from mankind’s inhabitation of the planet, not only change the landscapes of nature but also serve as driving forces of zoonotic disease emergences, thereby increasing the prevalence of already known zoonoses [1]. Various animals and arthropod reservoirs have been linked to the connection between human-related factors and the emergence of diseases, including rodents, birds, pigs, cows, bats, primates, camels, mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas [1,2]. It is important to study the various causes of emerging zoonoses, as these diseases account for more than 60% of infectious diseases encountered by humans and can create worldwide devastation as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic [3,4]. As mankind becomes more aware of the threats of pandemics, such as the plague, Spanish flu, and SARS-CoV-2, it is of great interest to better characterize ways to minimize activities that increase reservoirs or human–animal contact [3]. While it is seemingly impossible to completely stop new infections from spreading from animals to humans, it may be possible to reduce the severity of risks to the human population via quicker or more efficient methods of detection, early warning systems, and proper control or prevention policies if we better understand the activities that influence or drive these zoonotic transmissions [5]. While other reviews tend to focus on anthropogenic factors of land use changes influencing zoonoses or wildlife exploitations and impacts in separate reviews, we aim to make a more comprehensive exploration of these factors together as one big-picture view. By shedding light on human-related factors that increase zoonotic risks in this review, we aim to demonstrate the factors to consider when developing prevention and containment plans, such as urban risk management, pest policies, sanitation protocols, and public health awareness campaigns.\n\n2. Urbanization With urbanization comes many changes, such as demographic growth, migration of people and animals, and changes in land usage, that promote the potential for zoonoses [6]. Loss and modification of habits can drive animals to develop new patterns of human interactions [7]. Multidisciplinary, ecosystem-level analyses of Kuching, Malaysia, have demonstrated that urbanization creates a cascading effect of modifications to animal reservoirs, including arthropod vectors and microbes, which increases emergence risks, especially with regard to environmental and tick-borne infection transmissions [8]. Two species of rodents associated with pathogen transmission and observed in high concentrations in urbanized regions are Rattus rattus and Sundamys muelleri [8]. Rattus rattus contributes to environmental zoonoses, such as Leptospira spp., in which S. muelleri contributes to tick-borne zoonoses via Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes [8]. Rodents are amongst the most studied reservoirs in relation to urbanization. One very large study of a 48-year-long dataset of rodent-borne hemorrhagic fever-inducing hantaviruses in China, for ins"

        "full_text": "Background: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan has caused an outbreak and become a major public health issue in China and great concern from international community. Myocarditis and myocardial injury were suspected and may even be considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19.\n\nMethods: We enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis.\n\nResults: 112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis. Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at admission, that in 42 (37.5%) patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died. Troponin levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death. 15 (13.4%) patients have presented signs of pulmonary hypertension. Typical signs of myocarditis were absent on echocardiography and electrocardiogram.\n\nConclusions: The clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus. The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and systemic consequences and can be considered as the warning sign for recent adverse clinical outcomes of the patients."

        "full_text": "Abstract The presence of cardiovascular co-morbidities and the known effects of coronaviruses on the cardiovascular system have called attention to the potential implications for patients with cardiovascular risk factors. This evidence-based viewpoint will address two questions: (a) are individuals with underlying cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. high blood pressure or diabetes) or overt disease (e.g. coronary heart disease, heart failure, kidney disease) more likely to develop severe Covid-19 and to die than those without underlying conditions? (b) does the regular use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) make patients more likely to get infected and to die of Covid-19? With a necessary cautionary note that the evidence around the links between Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease is accruing at a fast pace, to date we can conclude that: (a) the greater susceptibility of individuals with underlying cardiovascular conditions to develop more severe Covid-19 with higher mortality rate is likely to be confounded, in part, by age and the type of co-morbidities. Patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease might show an excess risk; (b) neither ACE-i nor ARB are associated with greater risk of SARS-Cov2 infection, or severity or risk of death in patients with Covid-19. Patients on these drugs should not stop them, unless under strict medical supervision and with the addition of a suitable replacement medicine. Keywords: Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, Hypertension, Diabetes, Cardiovascular disease, ACE-Inhibitors, Angiotensin-receptor-blockers, Renin-angiotensin system\n\nIntroduction As of 14 May 2020, there have been 4,369,410 confirmed cases of Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the world, with 297,569 fatalities globally [1]. The epidemic originated in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, and spread rapidly throughout mainland China and worldwide, reaching pandemic proportions [2]. The clinical manifestations initially were of a viral pneumonia with fever, cough, fatigue and dyspnoea [2,3], severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) some requiring hospitalisation, with escalation to intensive care support with oxygen, mechanical ventilation and, eventually, death. The rapid dissemination of the pandemic trough Asia, Europe and North America has revealed additional patterns of presentation features, comorbidities and factors associated with mortality [3]. The presence of cardiovascular (CV) co-morbidities and the known effects of coronaviruses on the CV system have called attention to the potential implications for patients with CV risk factors [4]. This evidence-based viewpoint will attempt to answer two questions: (a) are individuals with underlying cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. high blood pressure or diabetes) or overt disease (e.g. coronary heart disease, heart failure, kidney disease) more likely to develop severe Covid-19 and to die than those without underlying conditions? (b) does the regular use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) make patients more likely to get infected and to die of Covid-19?\n\nCovid-19 and underlying CV risk The most common comorbidities among patients admitted to hospitals worldwide have been hypertension and diabetes, followed by cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. Table 1 summarises the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes recorded in 18 reports (10 from China [2,[6], [7], [8], [9],14,[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]], 3 from USA [5,13,15], 2 from Italy [10,11] and 1 from a multicentre study from 3 continents [12]) and, where available, the severity and mortality in hospitalised patients with confirmed Covid-19 by underlying risk factors. The reported prevalence of pre-existing hypertension varied from 12.2% [14] to 78.6% [13], and the prevalence of pre-existing diabetes varied from 7.4% [2] to 38.2% [13]. Furthermore, some studies reported an increased severity of symptoms in hospitalised patients with confirmed Covid-19 and underlying hypertension or diabetes, with a 2.7 and 3.8 folds higher severity [17] and with a fatality ratio up to 2.6 and 4.4 folds [2], respectively (Table 1). A meta-analysis of 2552 confirmed Covid-19 patients from 11 studies suggested that the severity of Covid-19 was higher in the presence of hypertension (pooled unadjusted OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.98 to 3.12) [22]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 6452 patients with Covid-19 from 30 studies showed that pre-existing diabetes was associated with poor outcome including severity of Covid-19 (unadjusted risk ratio 2.45, 95% CI 1.79 to 3.35) and mortality (unadjusted risk ratio 2.12, 1.44 to 3.11) [23]. Meta-regression indicated age and hypertension as the statistically significant explanatory variables of such associations. Table 1. Prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, and severity and outcom"

Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19.\n\nDesign, setting, and participants: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020.\n\nMain outcomes and measures: Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels.\n\nResults: Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (β = 0.530, P < .001) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (β = 0.613, P < .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P < .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (31 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 21.4% (36 of 168) (P = .13).\n\nConclusions and relevance: Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury."

However, many medical professional societies recommended their continued use given the paucity of clinical evidence, but there is a need for an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of the latest clinical studies. Methods and results A search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and various preprint servers for studies comparing clinical outcomes and mortality in COVID-19 patients on ACEIs and/or ARBs, and a meta-analysis was performed. A total of 16 studies were included for the review and meta-analysis. There were conflicting findings reported in the rates of severity and mortality in several studies. In a pooled analysis of four studies, there was a statistically non-significant association of ACEI/ARB use with lower odds of developing severe disease vs. non-users [odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.41–1.58, I2=50.52, P-value = 0.53). In a pooled analysis of six studies, there was a statistically non-significant association of ACEI/ARB use with lower odds of mortality as compared with non-users (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.53–1.41, I2 = 79.12, P-value = 0.55).

The initial cases were reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.1 Since then, there have been 3 041 764 confirmed COVID-19 patients in the world as of 27 April 2020, with a total of 211 167 deaths. The USA has the greatest number (988 189) of confirmed cases, with a total of 56 259 deaths. Most cases were diagnosed in New York (291 996), with a total of 22 668 deaths.2 Several studies, including a recent meta-analysis, have reported that co-existing conditions, including hypertension, cardiac diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes, were common among patients with COVID-19 who had severe illness, were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), received mechanical ventilation, or died than among patients who had mild illness.3,4 Notably, of the most frequent comorbidities reported in these studies of patients with COVID-19, hypertension in particular is often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).5 This could theoretically result in an up-regulation of ACE2, which is an active binding target for SARS-CoV-2 virus,6 in the epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels. Although this raised concerns regarding the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients, several animal studies presented conflicting findings regarding increased ACE2 expression due to ACEIs and ARBs, and previous human studies suggested that administration of an ACEI/ARB does not increase ACE2 expression.7 In light of these findings and a paucity of clinical outcome studies, many professional cardiovascular and hypertension societies including the European Society of Cardiology, Italian Society of Pharmacology, International Society of Hypertension (ISH), European Society of Hypertension, Joint American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/American Heart Failure Association, and others recommended the continued use of ACEIs/ARBs in COVID-19 patients.8–12 However, since the conception of these recommendations, several clinical studies have been conducted which evaluated the association of ACEIs and ARBs with clinical severity and mortality outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the medical literature was systematically reviewed, and a meta-analysis was performed of the current clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ACEs and ARBs in COVID-19 patients.\n\nMethods Literature search A literature search was conducted on the PubMed/MEDLINE database using keywords, i.e. ‘ACE inhibitors AND COVID’ and ‘ARB AND COVID’.

        "full_text": "Abstract Objectives: The effects of chronic renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers usage on adverse outcomes and disease severity remain uncertain in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. In this study, we aimed to determine the relationship between chronic use of RAAS inhibitors and in-hospital adverse events among hypertensive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective single-center study, we enrolled 349 consecutive hypertensive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. All patients were chronically on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/ angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) or other antihypertensive therapies before hospital admission. Adverse clinical events were defined as in-hospital mortality, admission to intensive care unit, need for high-flow oxygen and intubation. Results: Patients were categorized into two groups according to the type of antihypertensive therapy. (ACEI/ARBs users, N=201; ACEI/ARB nonusers, N=148) There was no statistically significant difference between ACEI/ARBs users and ACEI/ARBs nonusers concerning adverse clinical events, such as in-hospital mortality (29 (14.4%) vs. 20 (13.5%), p=0.81), ICU admission (45(22.4%) vs. 27 (18.2%), p=0.34), need for high-flow oxygen (97 (48.3%) vs. 68 (45.9%), p=0.67) and need for intubation (32(15.9%) vs. 23(15.5%), p=0.92), respectively. Also, the severity of infection did not differ among groups. The logistic regression multivariate analysis showed that age, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, procalcitonin and ferritin levels were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: Our results suggest that chronic use of ACEI/ARBs did not increase in-hospital adverse outcomes of hypertensive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Although the recent data are contradictory, chronic ACEI/ARB therapy is not recommended to be discontinued in hypertensive patients during their hospitalization for COVID-19. Keywords: COVID-19, hypertension, RAAS blockers, mortality, adverse clinical outcomes\n\nThe viral outbreak that arises from a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has currently emerged as a public health crisis since it has been declared as a pandemic in March, 2020. Defining the risk factors associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a major current focus of researchers due to the increasing number of confirmed cases and the rapid spread of the virus.\n\nIn most of the reports, patients with comorbidities, such as older age, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular diseases, were identified as more susceptible to the COVID-19 infection.[1, 2] Besides, HTN was reported as the most prevalent comorbidity of the COVID-19 and related to increased mortality.[3] Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are one of the first–line drugs used in hypertensive patients worldwide. It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) may upregulate the expression of ACE2 receptor, the direct entrance for the SARS-CoV-2, thus facilitate the penetration of the virus into the lung cells.[4, 5] This issue has recently attracted the attention of researchers, as RAAS inhibitors are commonly used among hypertensive patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Inversely, Kuba et al.[6] showed that expression of the ACE-2 receptor is downregulated following SARS-CoV-1 infection, causing RAAS hyperactivation and deterioration of pneumonia. Hence, it has been assumed that the use of ACEI/ARBs may be beneficial by the downregulation of ACE2 receptor expression and inhibition of RAAS hyperactivation after SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThe emerging data concerning the association between the use of ACEI/ARB and mortality in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 is still indefinite. Some reports suggested that ACEI/ARB usage may be related to disease progression and increased risk of death during hospitalization for COVID-19.[7, 8] On the contrary, it was reported that ACE2 converts angiotensin II, which is a proinflammatory vasoconstrictive and fibrotic agent, into angiotensin, thereby protecting the lungs from acute injury.[9] Thus, ACEI/ARBs may also ensure a benefit via this mechanism throughout the therapy. Based on these conflicting results, we aimed to investigate the association between chronic use of RAAS blockers and in-hospital adverse clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with HTN. Besides, a comprehensive evaluation of this issue may provide the optimal antihypertensive treatment strategy during the hospitalization of these patients.\n\nMethods In this study, 349 patients with HTN hospitalized for COVID-19 from March 10, 2020 to May 10,2020 were enrolled in our single-center study, and the data were retrospectively analyzed. The patients with the lack of in-hospital clinical data and the absence of pre-admission antihypertensive medication records were exclude"

However, ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared to those on non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs (OR = 0.48, 95 % CI, 0.29-0.81; P = 0.006). In conclusion, current evidence did not confirm the concern that ACEI/ARB exposure is harmful in patientswith COVID-19 infection. This study supports the current guidelines that discourage discontinuation of ACEIs or ARBs in COVID-19 patients and the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "full_text": "Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus has caused the outbreak of the acute respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China since December 2019. This study was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients who succumbed to and who recovered from 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n\nMethods: Clinical data were collected from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. A retrospective investigation was conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of fatal cases of COVID-19 (death group) and we compare them with recovered patients (recovered group). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed by χ test or Fisher exact test as appropriate.\n\nResults: Our study enrolled 109 COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization and 116 recovered patients. The median age of the death group was older than the recovered group (69 [62, 74] vs. 40 [33, 57] years, Z = 9.738, P < 0.001). More patients in the death group had underlying diseases (72.5% vs. 41.4%, χ = 22.105, P < 0.001). Patients in the death group had a significantly longer time of illness onset to hospitalization (10.0 [6.5, 12.0] vs. 7.0 [5.0, 10.0] days, Z = 3.216, P = 0.001). On admission, the proportions of patients with symptoms of dyspnea (70.6% vs. 19.0%, χ = 60.905, P < 0.001) and expectoration (32.1% vs. 12.1%, χ = 13.250, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the death group. The blood oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the death group (85 [77, 91]% vs. 97 [95, 98]%, Z = 10.625, P < 0.001). The white blood cell (WBC) in death group was significantly higher on admission (7.23 [4.87, 11.17] vs. 4.52 [3.62, 5.88] ×10/L, Z = 7.618, P < 0.001). Patients in the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count (0.63 [0.40, 0.79] vs. 1.00 [0.72, 1.27] ×10/L, Z = 8.037, P < 0.001) and lymphocyte percentage (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 23.50 [15.27, 31.25]%, Z = 10.315, P < 0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte percentage continued to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Z = 5.242, P < 0.001). Alanine transaminase (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] vs. 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Z = 2.592, P = 0.010), aspartate transaminase (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] vs. 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Z = 7.308, P < 0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] vs. 65.00 [54.60, 78.75] μmol/L, Z = 6.478, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the death group than those in the recovered group. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs. 3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Z = 10.206, P < 0.001) and showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs. 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Z = 1.219, P = 0.233). The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (89.9% vs. 8.6%, χ = 148.105, P < 0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs. 0.9%, χ = 93.222, P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs. 0%, χ = 23.257, P < 0.001), shock (11.9% vs. 0%, χ = 14.618, P < 0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs. 0%, χ = 7.655, P = 0.006).\n\nConclusions: Compared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels. More patients in the death group had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC."

Consideration should be made to exclude older physicians from front-line work.\n\nWe found 278 physicians who died with COVID-19 infection, but complete details were missing for 108 individuals. The average age of the physicians was 63.7 years with a median age of 66 years, and 90% were male (235/261). General practitioners and emergency room doctors (108/254), respirologists (5/254), internal medicine specialists (13/254) and anaesthesiologists (6/254) comprised 52% of those dying. Two per cent of the deceased were epidemiologists (5/254), 2% were infectious disease specialists (4/254), 6% were dentists (16/254), 4% were ENT (9/254) and 3% were ophthalmologists (8/254). The countries with the most reported physician deaths were Italy (121/278; 44%), Iran (43/278; 15%), Philippines (21/278; 8%), Indonesia (17/278; 6%), China (16/278; 6%), Spain (12/278; 4%), USA (12/278; 4%) and UK (11/278;4%).\n\nOn 15 April 2020, a Google internet search was performed using the keywords ‘doctor’, ‘physician’, ‘death’, ‘COVID’ and ‘coronavirus’ in English and Farsi, and Chinese using the Baidu search engine. The age, sex and medical speciality of physicians who died from COVID-19 in the line of duty were recorded. Individuals greater than 90 years of age were excluded.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over 3 million individuals worldwide with an overall 6.9% risk of death as of 27 April 2020 [ 1 ]. Physicians caring for COVID-19-infected patients are at high risk of contagion and possible mortality. To quantify and mitigate this risk, the underlying characteristics of physician deaths from COVID infection were investigated.\n\nPhysicians and dentists who died after contracting COVID-19 from patient care activities or interactions with medical colleagues were included. Where available, the doctor’s age, practice focus, gender, country and the date of the report were recorded. Retired doctors, practitioners over 90 years of age, and physicians who died from ‘exhaustion’ or myocardial infarction while caring for COVID-19 patients were also noted, but not included in the final database. Data were analysed using Stata 15.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).\n\nNo research ethics board approval was required for this publicly available information. On 15 April 2020, a Google internet search was performed using the keywords ‘doctor’, ‘medic’, ‘physician’, ‘die’, ‘death’, ‘COVID’, ‘COVID-19’ and ‘corona’ in English, and repeated in Farsi. An additional search was performed on Baidu (the Chinese version of Google) using the equivalent Chinese characters. An additional PubMed search was performed using the English search terms.\n\nTwenty-three per cent (58/192) of the physicians practised a surgical speciality with average age 62.9 years, compared to their primary care or medicine colleagues of average age 64.0 years. There was no statistically significant difference between the ages of the surgeons and non-surgeons (t-test, P = 0.61).\n\nNinety per cent (175/194) of the deceased physicians were male. General practitioners and emergency room doctors (78/254), respirologists (5/254), internal medicine specialists (11/254) and anaesthesiologists (6/254) comprised 52% of those dying. Two per cent of the deceased were epidemiologists (4/254), 2% were infectious disease specialists (4/254), 4% were ENT (8/254), 4% were ophthalmologists (7/254) and 5% were dentists (9/254) (see Table 1 ).\n\nPhysicians older than 90 years of age were excluded from this study. The age details were missing for 49 individuals. The average age of the physicians that died was 63.5 years (range 28–90 years) and the median age was 66.0 years. Physicians 59 years of age or older accounted for three-quarters of COVID-related deaths.\n\nFour physicians who were patient-facing but not proven to have COVID infection were not included in the final database; the apparent reasons for death included ‘cardiac compromise’ or ‘exhaustion’ [ 4–7 ]. Doctors that died from COVID infection not attributed to front-line work or interaction with work colleagues were also excluded [ 8 , 9 ].\n\nOn a PubMed search on 15 April 2020, no articles on physician deaths and COVID-19 were found. However, one letter discussed the death of 23 Chinese health care workers from COVID-19, two of whom were physicians [ 2 ]. Our internet search focused on physician deaths related to COVID-19 infection due to front-line work or interactions with work colleagues. The date of the reports ranged from 7 February 2020 to 15 April 2020. Complete age details were only available on 173 physicians.

        "full_text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected medical practice. More than 7,000,000 patients died worldwide after being infected with COVID-19; however, no specific laboratory markers have yet been established to predict death related to this disease. In contrast, electrocardiographic changes due to COVID-19 include QT prolongation and ST-T changes; however, there have not been studies on the ambulatory electrocardiographic markers of COVID-19. We encountered three patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 who did not have a prior history of significant structural heart diseases. All patients had abnormalities in ambulatory echocardiogram parameters detected by high-resolution 24 h electrocardiogram monitoring: positive late potentials (LPs) and T-wave alternans (TWA), abnormal heart rate variability (HRV), and heart rate turbulence (HRT). Case 1 involved a 78-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease, Case 2 involved a 76-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes, and Case 3 involved a 67-year-old man with renal cancer, lung cancer, and diabetes. None of them had a prior history of significant structural heart disease. Although no significant consistent increases in clinical markers were observed, all three patients died, mainly because of respiratory failure with mild heart failure. The LP, TWA, HRV, and HRT were positive in all three cases with no significant structural cardiac disease at the initial phase of admission. The further accumulation of data regarding ambulatory electrocardiographic markers in patients with COVID-19 is needed. Depending on the accumulation of data, the LP, TWA, HRV, and HRT could be identified as potential risk factors for COVID-19 pneumonia in the early phase of admission.\n\nRecently, noninvasive 24 h Holter electrocardiograms have been used to measure electrocardiographic markers as predictors of sudden cardiac death or lethal arrhythmia in patients with cardiac diseases, including ischemic heart disease and heart failure [ 6 , 7 , 8 ]. Noninvasive electrocardiogram markers derived from ambulatory electrocardiogram devices indicate the late potential (LP), T-wave alternans (TWA), heart rate turbulence (HRT), and heart rate variability (HRV); these parameters can be measured simultaneously during a single sampling inspection to predict fatal arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death in patients with structural heart disease [ 6 , 7 , 8 ]. These parameters are known as ambulatory electrocardiographic markers (AECG-Ms). However, the usefulness of AECG-Ms in the early phases of treating COVID-19 pneumonia has been seldom reported. Herein, we report three cases in which all AECG-Ms were positive in patients with COVID-19.\n\nMore than 7,000,000 patients have died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide [ 1 ]. Acute myocardial damage, cardiac conduction disturbances, and chronic cardiovascular injuries, including thrombosis, can occur with COVID-19 [ 2 , 3 ]. The increased risk of cardiac death in patients with COVID-19 who may or may not have had previous cardiovascular diseases has also been reported [ 4 ]. Although risk stratification in the early stages of COVID-19 is important when considering therapeutic strategies, surrogate markers have not yet been established to predict prognosis. Changes in the electrocardiograms of patients with COVID-19 include QT prolongation, ST-T changes, and other repolarization abnormalities [ 5 ].\n\nA 67-year-old man complaining of coughing and dyspnea was hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19. He had a history of renal and lung cancers and pancreatic diabetes but no significant cardiovascular diseases. His vital signs upon admission are shown in Table 1 . QT prolongation and ST-T changes are not shown ( Table 1 ). The laboratory data are summarized in Table 2 . An examination of the findings for this patient indicated that the levels of inflammatory markers were mildly elevated. The chest radiographs ( Figure 3 a) and computed tomography images ( Figure 3 b) revealed pneumonia. The echocardiographic findings are shown in Table 3 . A 24 h Holter electrocardiography performed upon admission showed that all AECG-Ms were positive ( Table 4 ). The patient was treated with heparin, remdesivir, and dexamethasone at a dose of 6.6 mg/day for 5 days. Oxygen saturation showed improvement on day 4 after admission, but the patient’s condition worsened from day 6, the BNP level increased from 162 pg/mL to 611 pg/mL, and carbon dioxide narcosis was induced. He was treated with methylprednisolone at a dose of 1000 mg/day for 3 days, remdesivir at a dose of 100 mg/day for 9 days, and heparin at a dose of 5000 U/day for 4 days, but he died from pneumonia with HFpEF on day 10 after admission.\n\nA 76-year-old man complaining of dyspnea was hospitalized after being diagnosed as having COVID-19 using a real-time polymerase chain reaction test.

All cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin.\n\nIn vitro RNA expression (qRT-PCR) In vitro mRNA expression of the plasmid was demonstrated by transfection of COS-7 with serially diluted plasmids followed by analysis of the total RNA extracted from the cells using reverse transcription and PCR. Transfections of four concentrations of the plasmid were performed using FuGENE® 6 transfection reagent (Promega) which resulted in final masses ranging between 80 and 10 ng per well. The transfections were performed in duplicate. Following 18 to 26 h of incubation the cells were lysed with RLT Buffer (Qiagen). Total RNA was isolated from each well using the Qiagen RNeasy kit following the kit instructions. The resulting RNA concentration was determined by OD 260/280 and samples of the RNA were diluted to 10 ng per µL. One hundred nanograms of RNA was then converted to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription (RevT) kit (Applied Biosystems) following the kit instructions. RevT reactions containing RNA but no reverse transcriptase (minus RT) were included as controls for plasmid DNA or cellular genomic DNA sample contamination. Eight microliters of sample cDNA were then subjected to PCR using primers and probes that are specific to the target sequence (pGX9501 Forward – CAGGACAAGAACACACAGGAA; pGX9501 Reverse – CAGGCAGGATTTGGGAGAAA; pGX9501 Probe – ACCCATCAAGGACTTTGGAGG; and pGX9503 Forward – AGGACAAGAACACACAGGAAG; pGX9503 Reverse – CAGGATCTGGGAGAAGTTGAAG; pGX9503 Probe – ACACCACCCATCAAGGACTTTGGA). In a separate reaction, the same quantity of sample cDNA was subjected to PCR using primers and a probe designed (β-actin Forward – GTGACGTGGACATCCGTAAA; β-actin Reverse – CAGGGCAGTAATCTCCTTCTG; β-actin Probe – TACCCTGGCATTGCTGACAGGATG) for COS-7 cell line β-actin sequences. The primers and probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. and the probes were labeled with 56-FAM and Black Hole Quencher 1. The reaction used ABI Fast Advance 2×(Cat. No. 4444557), with final forward and reverse primer concentrations of 1 µM and probe concentrations of 0.3 µM. Using a QuantStudio 7 Flex Real Time PCR Studio System (Applied Biosystems), samples were first subjected to a hold of 1 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of PCR with each cycle consisting of 1 s at 95 °C and 20 s at 60 °C. Following PCR, the amplifications results were analyzed as follows. The negative transfection controls, the minus RevT controls, and the NTC were scrutinized for each of their respective indications. The threshold cycle (C T ) of each transfection concentration for the INO-4800 COVID-19 target mRNA and for the β-actin mRNA was generated from the QuantStudio software using an automatic threshold setting. The plasmid was considered to be active for mRNA expression if the expression in any of the plasmid transfected wells compared with the negative transfection controls were greater than 5 C T .\n\nIn vitro protein expression (Western blot)\n\nHuman embryonic kidney cells, 293T were cultured and transfected as described previously42. 293T cells were transfected with pDNA using TurboFectin8.0 (OriGene) transfection reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol. Forty-eight hours later cell lysates were harvested using modified RIPA cell lysis buffer. Proteins were separated on a 4–12% BIS-TRIS gel (ThermoFisher Scientific), then following transfer, blots were incubated with an anti-SARS-CoV spike protein polyclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals) then visualized with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (GE Amersham).\n\nImmunofluorescence of transfected 293T cells\n\nFor in vitro staining of Spike protein expression 293T cells were cultured on 4-well glass slides (Lab-Tek) and transfected with 3 µg per well of pDNA using TurboFectin8.0 (OriGene) transfection reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were fixed 48 h after transfection with 10% Neutral-buffered Formalin (BBC Biochemical, Washington State) for 10 min at RT and then washed with PBS. Before staining, chamber slides were blocked with 0.3% (v/v) Triton-X (Sigma), 2% (v/v) donkey serum in PBS for 1 h at RT.

        "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77466-4",
        "full_text": "2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019, following a series of unexplained pneumonia cases1. Currently, the disease is rated as a global pandemic by The World Health Organization with case reports from all continents, as of 4 October 2020 the disease has infected more than 34 million people and has claimed more 1 million lives globally2. Vaccine development is of high priority, and a number of public and private initiatives are focused on this task3. Many of the ongoing vaccine development efforts are focused on raising an immune response against the spike protein. However, the spike protein only makes up 1/8 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, so this vaccine strategy may inadvertently miss a lot of potential immune reactivity. SARS-CoV-2 has a large proteome4. Immune deconvolution to identify T cell epitopes will require initial filtering to assess which SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides are likely to bind a given HLA allele and to be presented on the surface of infected cells from where it can activate passing T cells. The core binding groove of most MHC class I molecules can accommodate 9 amino acid residues, with some variation or suspected impact of flanking positions5,6. MHC class II has been described to bind longer peptides (up to 13–25 residues long) interacting with the open binding groove7. Providing the possibility for further inspection of the importance of the binding motif and its flanking regions.\n\nSeveral computational tools (a selection is presented in Table 1) have been developed that can predict the binding of peptides to HLA. Traditionally, these tools were trained using data from affinity assays8, but more recently many of them also incorporate data from peptides identified by HLA ligandome analysis. Most tools rely on small neural networks (NN) or variations of position-specific weight matrices (PSSM), to calculate the probability of a peptide matching a consensus motif or model.\n\nTable 1 Current best-performing or novel HLA prediction tools10. Full size table\n\nNetMHC tools (such as NetMHC, NetMHCII, NetMHCpan, NetMHCIIpan and others) have been under constant development and have consistently performed well throughout the last decade9,10,11,12. Several tools are restricted in terms of which alleles are available for prediction, in particular for MHC class II. This restriction is primarily determined by the availability of training data, for which the largest public collection is currently the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)13. Attempts to overcome this limitation have been made via sequence-to-sequence predictions, most notably for NetMHCpan14. A number of recent publications makes use of prediction tools to suggest vaccine candidate epitopes for SARS-CoV-215,16,17.\n\nTo assess whether current peptide-HLA prediction tools could be suitable for identification of epitopes relevant in a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, we tested binders predicted by the netMHC tools, using a new peptide-MHC complex-stability assay NeoScreen on ten HLA class I alleles and one HLA class II allele. The selection of class I alleles broadly covers populations across different ethnic origins (Table S1). Subsequently, we chose all tools included in the benchmark recently reviewed by Mei et al.10, excluding the three tools with the lowest performance (MHCnuggets, HLA-CNN and RANKPEP), as well as SYFPEITHI which could not be brought to run on our system. Furthermore, we added newly developed tools such as HLAthena and DeepHLAPan and a standard tool SMM 1.0 to offer a comprehensive representation of the current prediction tool landscape (Table 1). Most of the selected tools are periodically tested in the IEDB Automated Benchmark35,36.\n\nWe found that algorithmically predicting binding between epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 and HLA outputs many complexes that turned out to exhibit low stability. Such peptides are thus very unlikely to elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore unsuitable for vaccine development. To investigate if this finding was a result of the quality of available training data, we constructed a proof-of-concept prediction model for HLA-A*02:01, which we trained on 2193 historic in-house stability data points, and found that it outperforms other tools. Training data was primarily human cancer-derived or based on random sequences. SARS-CoV-2 peptides that we validated as binding or non-binding in this study are freely available for use to assist in vaccine design against COVID-19."

The causative agent has been identified in a virus belonging to theCoronaviridae family, similar to the agent of SARS, referred to as SARS-CoV-2.

Although vaccine development is at a very advanced stage, there are currently no truly effective antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we present systematic and integrative antiviral drug repurposing effort aimed at identifying, among the drugs already authorized for clinical use, some active inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The most important result of this analysis is the demonstration that ethacrynic acid, a powerful diuretic, is revealed to be an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Even with all the necessary cautions, given the particular nature of this drug, these data can be the starting point for the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2."

Articles presenting clinical data for patients with coronavirus infection (defined as SARS-1, MERS, SARS-CoV-2, and other coronavirus) and bacterial/fungal coinfection reported in English, Mandarin, or Italian were included. Data describing bacterial/fungal coinfections, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Secondary analysis of studies reporting antimicrobial prescribing in SARS-CoV-2 even in absence of coinfection was performed.\n\nResults: 1007 abstracts were identified. Eighteen full texts reporting bacterial/fungal coinfection were included. Most studies did not identify or report bacterial/fungal coinfection (85/140; 61%). Nine of 18 (50%) studies reported on COVID-19, 5/18 (28%) on SARS-1, 1/18 (6%) on MERS, and 3/18 (17%) on other coronaviruses. For COVID-19, 62/806 (8%) patients were reported as experiencing bacterial/fungal coinfection during hospital admission. Secondary analysis demonstrated wide use of broad-spectrum antibacterials, despite a paucity of evidence for bacterial coinfection. On secondary analysis, 1450/2010 (72%) of patients reported received antimicrobial therapy. No antimicrobial stewardship interventions were described. For non-COVID-19 cases, bacterial/fungal coinfection was reported in 89/815 (11%) of patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotic use was reported.\n\nConclusions: Despite frequent prescription of broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials in patients with coronavirus-associated respiratory infections, there is a paucity of data to support the association with respiratory bacterial/fungal coinfection. Generation of prospective evidence to support development of antimicrobial policy and appropriate stewardship interventions specific for the COVID-19 pandemic is urgently required."

        "full_text": "COVID-19 is a life-threatening disease with no proven effective therapy. There are a few high-quality randomized control trials that evaluated the effectiveness of CQ/HCQ in the management of COVID-19. This attempt was followed by many reported poor methodologically designed observation studies that addressed the role of these drugs alone or in combination with AZM in facing this pandemic. Of note, most of these studies recruited few heterogeneous numbers of participants aimed at studying different outcomes with variable endpoints providing different doses of drugs for different durations.\n\nIn this study, we shed the light on the effectiveness and safety of CQ/HCQ with or without AZM in the management of COVID-19 to provide robust evidence for health policy decision-makers to face the ongoing pandemic. We included 14 articles to study the desired outcomes. The included studies according to their design were three RCT, two non-CT, three case-control, and six retro or prospective cohort. All included studies were conducted at hospitals. In the systematic review section, the highest number of recruited patients in a single study was 143835, while the smallest number was 11 subjects29. The outcome that included the highest number of patients in pooled outcome analysis was mortality (3868 patients), while the smallest number of patients was included in studying the effectiveness of HCQ and AZM in achieving virologic cure (54 patients).\n\nBased on the finding of this meta-analysis, mortality of the HCQ group was not different from that of SC. The country of residency was a significant predictor of mortality outcomes. The alarming finding was that SC patients had lower numbers of mortalities if they were compared to the AZM and HCQ combination group. Exposure to HCQ was associated with a longer duration of hospital stay, whether AZM was included or not in the treatment regimen. Generally, exposure to HCQ alone or in combination with AZM was not associated with any witnessed decrease in the need for mechanical ventilation. Regarding the difference in viral clearance between HCQ and SC, the time to negative conversion was not statistically different between the two groups (HCQ and SC). Similarly, virologic cure rates at either day 4, day 10, or day 14were not different between both groups. It is worthy to mention that adding AZM to HCQ did not affect the cure rate compared to SC. Furthermore, neither clinical worsening nor radiological improvement of the studied patients was affected concurrently with exposure to HCQ. Side effects were more encountered if patients were treated with HCQ/CQ.\n\nMortality HCQ and AZM\n\nIn the current research, mortality rate of HCQ alone did not significantly differ from that of the SC. Due to high heterogeneity and failure of sensitivity analysis to identify the source of heterogeneity, we carried out meta-regression analysis. In Meta-regression analysis, the heterogeneity dropped to 22% and we identified that country was a strong predictor of mortality. The insignificant difference in mortality after exposure to HCQ was similar to what was reported by Shamshirian et al.58 who almost included the same studies in their meta-analysis with a high heterogeneity of 86.93%. However, in their meta-regression analysis age was the only significant predictor of mortality concurrently with exposure to HCQ. We speculate that not only receiving HCQ is the only predictor of mortality, but also access, quality, and availability of health services within different countries are considered as a strong predictors of disease prognosis59. However, a country like France that provides one of the best health services worldwide, had witnessed the second-highest number of case-fatality ratio due to COVID-19 (5.9%) after Mexico (10.5%). On the other hand, a country like Morocco which is ranked 29th on the list of the world health system had a case fatality ratio of 1.8%60,61. These discrepancies in case fatality ratio despite the difference in health service quality may trigger the need for studying other determinants of disease outcome in different countries like ethnicity, population age structure62, national interventional measures (i.e. lockdown strategies), PCR testing capabilities63, the bias in a testing (more diseased individuals are priority) cultural habits, viral strains, and history of previous vaccinations (BCG vaccine)64. Notably, one of the alarming findings was that mortality of the HCQ and AZM was significantly higher than SC (pooled RR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.19–2.77). This significant risk ratio remained even after excluding a study that had a high risk of bias. The increased mortality of this combination may be due to the increased risk of arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. The arrhythmogenic effect of HCQ is due to its structural similarity with quinidine (Class 1A antiarrhythmic drug.) This group inhibits voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels resulting in QT prolongation and increased risk of tors"

        "full_text": "Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease that affected tens of millions of people, upended the lives of countless individuals around the globe. The chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were the most frequently cited as potential treatments and preventatives against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The primary aim of this investigation was to scrutinize the effectiveness and safety of HCQ for COVID-19 prevention and to present powerful evidence and reference for clinical practice.\n\nMethods: PubMed, Ovid and the Cochrane COVID-19 Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were systematically searched from inception to January 31, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) trials that included participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at the time of registration were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The intervention group took HCQ or CQ orally. The control group was not blinded by quinine or placebo. Pooled relative risk (RR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mortality, hospitalization, adverse events, and compliance were calculated. The software tools utilized for statistical analyses were Stata 14 and Review Manager 5.3.\n\nResults: A total of 9 studies including 7,825 participants were enrolled. Bias of individual studies were assessed as low risk. The pooled RR for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-0.83] (z=-4.01, P<0.0001; I2=11%). The pooled RR for hospitalization was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.35-1.50) (z=0.87, P=0.39; I2=0.0%). The pooled RR for mortality and adverse events were 3.26 (95% CI: 0.13-79.74) (z=0.72, P=0.47; I2=0.0%) and 1.90 (95% CI: 1.20-3.02) (z=2.73, P=0.0063; I2=94%).\n\nConclusions: Results of this meta-analysis indicated significant impact of HCQ on SARS-CoV-2 infection with higher risk of adverse events. These findings must be considered with caution, and further research is necessary to delineate the specific circumstances where HCQ may be effective for COVID-19 prevention."

        "full_text": "We read the recent letter by De Franceschi et al. [1] attributing acute intravascular hemolysis in a patient with COVID-19 infection to intake of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). We would like to highlight some inconsistencies and a lack of clarity in the report. Moreover, we would like to do a thorough literature review on the existing controversy [2] on whether hemolysis is induced by chloroquine (CQ) or HCQ in G6PD-deficient patients to which the authors were relied on.\n\nSince the authors themselves stated in the manuscript that the index patient was a ‘suspected’ case of G6PD-deficiency, and not confirmed, we think it is exploratory to put a title that denoted G6PD-deficiency. The testing for G6PD deficiency is fairly common and nowadays feasible even during episodes of acute hemolysis and it was surprising why the test couldn't be done to confirm the authors’ suspicions. The inconsistency in the report is visible even in the discussion part. The authors were cautioning about the pro-hemolytic effects of CQ-HCQ during the introduction, and at the same time highlighting the lack of conclusive data for the same in the concluding paragraph; by citing supporting literature. Of these three literature references, two [3,4] are proofs against pro-hemolytic effects of CQ-HCQ, and the third one was literature on primaquine, an 8-aminoquinoline (unlike CQ-HCQ which are 4-aminoquinolines).\n\nIt must be considered that CQ-and HCQ are not novel drugs but have been used for the treatment of multiple infectious and inflammatory disorders for more than 50 years. Hemolysis due to administration of CQ-HCQ in patients with G6PD-deficiency has not been conclusively proven in any of the large trials using CQ and HCQ [3], [4], [5]. The belief of ‘antimalarials’ causing hemolysis, unfortunately, became engraved in the minds of clinicians by the well-founded evidence on hemolysis by primaquine. A seminal study by Youngster et al. [3] refuted such claims and categorically suggested the lack of evidence of CQ (thus its hydroxy derivative, HCQ) causing hemolysis in patients with G6PD-deficiency. A recent meta-analysis of clinical trials in CQ+/- primaquine, did not demonstrate a significant drop in hemoglobin from baseline in G6PD-deficients on CQ monotherapy [5]. No incidents of hemolysis were observed in 11 G6PD-deficient patients even after >700 months of HCQ exposure as per the largest US study that examined the occurrence of hemolysis with hydroxychloroquine [4].\n\nThe trend of major hemolytic parameters was lacking in the text, except for the peripheral smear findings. It should also be considered that, sometimes, a 1-2 g/dL drop in hemoglobin can occur in the first few days of admission after hydration with IV fluids, blood draws etc. As per the graph, one can observe an initial dip of hemoglobin from 15.0g/dL to 12.5g/dL at 48 hrs that normalized to 14.5g/dL within a day, which raises suspicion on the actual course of hemolysis. Moreover, a high D-dimer level seen in this patient can be considered an indirect indicator of the severity of COVID-19 infection in the patient [6]. There is emerging evidence on the complement-mediated pro-coagulated state, a pre-requisite for the atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS), in patients with COVID-19 [7]. This also warrants further clarity, and the need to exclude other possible causes of hemolysis in a patient with severe COVID-19 infection, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Apart from this, COVID-19 infection poses an important confounding factor here, since the infections are the most common trigger for hemolysis in G6PD-deficiency [4]. In a similar report by Beauverd et al., [8] hemolysis was observed even before starting hydroxychloroquine, in a G6PD-deficient COVID-19 patient [9].\n\nLastly, the contribution of lopinavir in the hemolytic peripheral smear picture should also be considered. Lopinavir is known to cause eryptosis (erythrocyte apoptosis characterized by erythrocyte membrane changes) and this may be aggravated in the context of G6PD-deficiency [10].\n\nIn summary, the authors did not establish G6PD-deficiency in the index patient and thus attributing the hemolysis to HCQ, should be considered exploratory. The presence of confounding factors like COVID-19 infection, suspected DIC with high D-dimer, concurrent administration of lopinavir, along with lack of robust supporting evidence preclude establishing hydroxychloroquine as the sole cause for hemolysis in the patient. To conclude, linking CQ-HCQ with hemolysis in G6PD-deficient subjects based on the present report with above-mentioned confounding factors and inconsistencies is against the established scientific evidence [3], [4], [5].\n\nFunding source None"

In this descriptive observational study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of HCQ in COVID-19 infected patients and 30 cases were included. The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) before and after HCQ therapy and clinical outcome in the 30 patients with COVID-19 were assessed. To evaluate the effect of mediation time point, we also divided these cases into two groups, patients began administrated with HCQ within 7 days hospital (defined as early delivery group) and 7 days after hospital (defined as later delivery group). We found that, the elevated IL-6, a risk factor in severe patients were reduced to normal level after HCQ treatment. More importantly, patients treated with HCQ at the time of early hospital recovered faster than those who treated later or taken as second line choose for their obvious shorter hospitalization time. In summary, early use of HCQ was better than later use and the effect of IL-6 and CRP level cannot be ruled out."

        "full_text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific drugs and high fatality. The most urgent need is to find effective treatments. We sought to determine whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) application may reduce the death risk of critically ill COVID-19 patients. In this retrospective study, we included 550 critically ill COVID-19 patients who need mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, from February 1, 2020 to April 4, 2020. All 550 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them were treated with oral HCQ treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days) in addition to the basic treatments. Primary endpoint is fatality of patients, and inflammatory cytokine levels were compared between HCQ and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments. We found that fatalities are 18.8% (9/48) in HCQ group, which is significantly lower than 47.4% (238/502) in the NHCQ group (P<0.001). The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4-14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (P<0.05). The levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were significantly reduced from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg mL-1 at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg mL-1 (P<0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group. These data demonstrate that addition of HCQ on top of the basic treatments is highly effective in reducing the fatality of critically ill patients of COVID-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm. Therefore, HCQ should be prescribed as a part of treatment for critically ill COVID-19 patients, with possible outcome of saving lives. hydroxychloroquine, IL-6, mortalities, COVID-19."

Investigators of ongoing, discontinued, or completed trials were contacted via email to provide group-level (aggregated) mortality data per trial arm at any time point available. The protocol was published online before data collection40. This review has been reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis41. The PRISMA checklist can be found in the supplement (Supplement 1).\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nWe considered all clinical trials that reported randomly allocating patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection to a treatment protocol containing HCQ or CQ (for any duration or dose) or the same treatment protocol not containing HCQ or CQ. In other words, the control group had to receive placebo or no treatment other than standard of care (we excluded comparisons of HCQ or CQ against an active treatment, e.g., HCQ versus azithromycin, since active controls were too heterogeneous to pool together and reveal the pure benefits and harms of HCQ or CQ). Eligible ongoing trials had to provide data on all-cause mortality and randomize the first patient before June 1, 2020 (time point selected arbitrarily as we did not expect trials launched later to recruit enough patients to provide relevant additional information). Trials that were published or posted as preprint were not restricted by date. Prevention trials were not included. We included trials regardless of follow-up time and whether mortality was a primary outcome or not; moreover, we put no restrictions on trial status, language, geographical region, or healthcare setting.\n\nSearch strategy\n\nWe searched for eligible trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) by June 11, 2020 (COVID-evidence database; see Supplement 2)42. We additionally searched PubMed and the Cochrane COVID-19 trial registry (covering preprints, trial registries, and literature databases) by June 11, 2020, using terms related to HCQ and CQ combined with terms for COVID-19 and a standard RCT filter (Supplement 2)43. We updated the literature search on October 16, 2020. Two authors (C.A. and A.M.S.) independently verified the eligibility criteria (Fig. 1) and solved any discrepancies by discussion.\n\nPrincipal investigators of 83 potentially eligible trials were asked to confirm the eligibility criteria, as well as: “For each of your study arms: (a) What intervention did this group receive? (b) How many patients were randomized to this group? (c) Of these patients, how many have died? (d) Of these patients, for how many it is unknown if they are dead or alive?” (Supplement 3, email template). Investigators who were not responsive received two email reminders in English or Chinese, depending on trial origin.\n\nData extraction\n\nThe following information was extracted from all included RCTs by two reviewers (C.A. and A.M.S.) and verified by the trial investigators: experimental and control arms, number of randomized participants, treatment schedule, patient setting, eligibility criteria, study location, blinding, target sample size, and trial status. In all trials that used hydroxychloroquine, we extracted dosages referring to hydroxychloroquine sulfate. In trials that used chloroquine, the dosages for ARCHAIC, ChiCTR2000030054 and ChiCTR2000031204 refer to chloroquine phosphate, while those for CloroCOVID19II and CloroCOVID19III refer to chloroquine base. We also classified trials as published in a peer-reviewed journal, posted on a preprint server, or unpublished (the latter category not including preprints). For reasons of feasibility within this rapid assessment, we generally did not request descriptive information beyond items included in trial registrations.\n\nRisk of bias assessment\n\nTwo reviewers (C.A. and A.M.S.) independently assessed the risk of bias of included RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias tool 2.044. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. We used the information reported in preprints and journal publications, and for unpublished trials, we retrieved information from trial registrations, which was confirmed by trial investigators. We also assessed small-study effects with an inverted funnel plot and Egger’s test43. The presence of small-study effects may be suggestive, but not definitive, of publication bias45.\n\nData synthesis and analyses\n\nThe main analysis evaluated separately the effect on all-cause mortality of HCQ versus control and CQ versus control. We report absolute numbers and proportions, as well as the treatment effect estimate as an odds ratio (OR; odds of death in the HCQ or CQ intervention group divided by the odds of death in the control group) with 95% CIs. For multi-arm studies, we requested data for all arms and calculated treatment effect estimates for each eligible comparison. We combi"

        "full_text": "Highlights • The viral load and viral shedding patterns of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 were described.\n\n• The viral load of asymptomatic patients peaked during the early stage of hospitalization.\n\n• The Ct values of asymptomatic patients (APs) were higher than asymptomatic patients in incubation period (APIs).\n\n• APs still have a duration of viral shedding, suggesting the possibility of transmission during the asymptomatic period. Keywords: COVID-19, Asymptomatic patients, Viral load, Viral shedding\n\nAbstract Data are limited on the viral load, viral shedding patterns, and potential infectivity of asymptomatic patients (APs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study included 31 adult patients who were virologically confirmed to have COVID-19 but were asymptomatic on admission. Among these 31 patients, 22 presented symptoms after admission and were defined as asymptomatic patients in the incubation period (APIs); the other nine patients remained asymptomatic during hospitalization and were defined as asymptomatic patients (APs). The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of APs (39.0, interquartile range (IQR) 37.5–39.5) was significantly higher than that of APIs (34.5, IQR 32.2–37.0), indicating a lower viral load in APs. However, the duration of viral shedding remained similar in the two groups (7 days, IQR 5–14 days vs. 8 days, IQR 5–16 days). The study findings demonstrated that although APs with COVID-19 have a lower viral load, they still have certain period of viral shedding, which suggests the possibility of transmission during their asymptomatic period. Further longitudinal surveillance of these asymptomatic cases via virus nucleic acid testing are warranted.\n\nIn late December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) struck Wuhan, China, and then rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic. New evidence has shown that the majority of people with coronavirus infections do not present symptoms, which indicates that a large number of asymptomatic carriers remain undiscovered in the community (Bai et al., 2020, Day, 2020). To understand the natural history and infectiousness of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, we followed up virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital who had no subjective symptoms on admission, and investigated their viral load and viral shedding patterns.\n\nThis study included 31 adult patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 and were hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital from January 23 to March 3, 2020. All of these patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA according to real-time RT-PCR assays conducted in the hospital or the local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but were asymptomatic on admission. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program 6th edition (National Health Commission of China, 2020).\n\nIn this study, a commercial real-time PCR kit (Zhongzhi, Guangzhou, China) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (World Health Organization, 2020). The open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N) genes were targeted simultaneously, and were amplified and tested. The detailed protocol has been described elsewhere (National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention China, 2020). Clinical samples were quantified and the results expressed in terms of the cycle threshold value (Ct-value), which is defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescence signal to cross the threshold (i.e., exceed the background level). Samples were considered positive if the Ct-value was ≤40, and only Ct values of positive test results were available. The viral load of patient nasopharyngeal swab samples was estimated by Ct value of the N gene, with lower Ct values indicating a higher viral load.\n\nAmong 31 participants who did not show any subjective symptoms on admission, 22 presented symptoms after admission; these patients were defined as asymptomatic patients in the incubation period (APIs). The other nine patients remained asymptomatic during hospitalization (APs). The baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the AP and API groups (Supplementary material Table S1). All patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scans on admission and were followed up every 3 days or as necessary. Four (44.44%) APs and nine (41.93%) APIs showed bilateral abnormalities typical of pneumonia. Of the 22 APIs, six (27.27%) showed radiographic progression 8 days (interquartile range (IQR) 7–9 days) after admission, but all exhibited improvement before discharge (Figure 1 ).\n\nFigure 1.

        "full_text": "Abstract With the presence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) asymptomatic infections detected, their proportion, transmission potential, and other aspects such as immunity and related emerging challenges have attracted people’s attention. We have found that based on high-quality research, asymptomatic infections account for at least one-third of the total cases, whereas based on systematic review and meta-analysis, the proportion is about one-fifth. Evaluating the true transmission potential of asymptomatic cases is difficult but critical, since it may affect national policies in response to COVID-19. We have summarized the current evidence and found, compared with symptomatic cases, the transmission capacity of asymptomatic individuals is weaker, even though they have similar viral load and relatively short virus shedding duration. As the outbreak progresses, asymptomatic infections have also been found to develop long COVID-19. In addition, the role of asymptomatic infection in COVID-19 remains to be further revealed as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants continue to emerge. Nevertheless, as asymptomatic infections transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus silently, they still pose a substantial threat to public health. Therefore, it is essential to conduct screening to obtain more knowledge about the asymptomatic infections and to detect them as soon as possible; meanwhile, management of them is also a key point in the fight against COVID-19 community transmission. The different management of asymptomatic infections in various countries are compared and the experience in China is displayed in detail. Keywords: asymptomatic, coronavirus disease 2019, pre-symptomatic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n\nSince the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic worldwide. As of 12 December 2021, more than 260 million cases have been confirmed globally, resulting in over 5 million deaths [1]. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from severe pneumonia to mild acute upper respiratory symptoms, as well as asymptomatic carriers [2]. With the expansion of laboratory testing capabilities, more and more COVID-19 cases of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infection have been detected. They have drawn considerable attention to the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, there have been many studies on asymptomatic infections of COVID-19, but the results are hard to reach a consensus. Here we try to put current knowledge together to provide a relatively comprehensive understanding of asymptomatic infections in the COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, the magnitude of asymptomatic cases is described to find out how common they are. And we explore the extent to which the asymptomatic carriers may play a role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We then discuss their immunity and how vaccination influences the asymptomatic infection. Recent perspectives into some emerging challenges of asymptomatic individuals, like long COVID-19 and new variants, are also described here. Ultimately, the different managements of asymptomatic infections in various countries are compared and the experience in China is displayed in detail. Due to the nature of asymptomatic infections, we still less understand their aspect of the COVID-19 spectrum. But this should not allow us to ignore their contributions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only is further research urgently needed to find out the truth about asymptomatic infections, but we should also emphasize the importance of screening and managing them.\n\nDefinition of asymptomatic infection and pre-symptomatic infection in COVID-19 Asymptomatic infection can be defined as persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who never develop COVID-19-related clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, or diarrhea during illness. And pre-symptomatic infection is defined as persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who have no symptoms at diagnosis time or the early phase of infection but develop COVID-19-related clinical symptoms during follow-up [3].\n\nThe magnitude of asymptomatic infections The proportion of asymptomatic infections estimated via testing The estimated proportion of asymptomatic infections Many viral infections such as influenza are associated with asymptomatic infections, with an estimated proportion of 5.2%–35.5% [4]. Asymptomatic infections had occurred during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which were also caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs), SARS-CoV (2003), and MERS-CoV (2012), respectively. In Taiwan, China, a survey of 623 healthy healthcare workers who treated SARS patients found asymptomatic seroconversions in only two hospitals where four out of 433 healthcare workers had SARS antibodies (0.92%) [5].

        "full_text": "Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. As a result, none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and 5 (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining 7 (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These 7 cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P=0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Overall, the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged."

        "full_text": "Commentary\n\nAs the second wave is spreading through Europe, a more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant has recently been identified in the U.K.. The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have reached another level as populations go weary of suppression strategies, such as quarantine, isolation, and social distancing [9].\n\nLuckily, new means in the fight against COVID-19 became available as the first vaccines received approval from national health agencies with hope to regain normality [5]. Recent reports from non-mitigated environment have however shown a three quarter attack rate from SARS-CoV-2 [2], meanwhile European serologic studies indicated after the first wave a seroprevalence of ~10–15% [3], underlying the yet long way to go to control the disease.\n\nIn this issue of Lancet Regional Health- Europe, an article by Taylor et al. provides several important insights in the fight against COVID-19 [7]. Their study focusses on adults from a military environment, which is a relevant group to ensure any subsidiary engagement in supporting civil institutions and hospitals [1]. To some extent, their findings may apply to other essential workers group with fairly young and healthy populations, such as healthcare professionals, police force, or firefighters, that are crucial for adequate response to the challenges COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPerformed in the closed community and high-density population of a military barracks of London, U.K., Taylor et al. reported a high seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 at the start of their observational study, consistent with the fact that, when uncontrolled, the virus can spread swiftly among a particular population. On the other hand, after implementing appropriate measures, they were able to control the spread of the disease better than in open environment of the surrounding London.\n\nThe study found high rates (64%) of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among a young and healthy population (median age 28 years old, interquartile range 23–36). Interestingly, the study separately analysed and reported positive nasopharyngeal swab by RT-PCR – the “common” COVID-19 test – and proof of infective virus determined by cytopathic effect [7]. The former being only of proof of presence of viral RNA [4], it is important to realize that only one third of positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR had infective virus.\n\nThey also identified individuals simultaneously positive for SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR and serologic testing for antibodies. However, infective virus was never recovered in nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR-positive patients that had neutralising antibodies, that is, antibodies that don't necessarily require cellular interaction to neutralise the pathogen. Neutralising antibodies may be a key to distinguish individuals with a protective immunity to self and to others, from those yet to eradicate the virus from their body and potential covert spreader of the infection [1].\n\nIn the study by Taylor et al., more than 60% of seroconverters had neutralising antibodies. In another recent large scale study, the rate of seroconverters with neutralising antibodies against the spike protein was above 90% [8]. Different rates may be explained by different target antigens (nucleoprotein vs. spike) and by different study populations. Importantly, evidence from other reports show that neutralising antibodies are thought to last for months with low antibody waning [8] and being built irrespective of symptoms [6].\n\nIn conclusion, Taylor et al. should be complimented for their study. Investigations of young and healthy populations may seem less relevant in the fight against COVID-19. However, a better understanding of how to distinguish asymptomatic covert spreaders from individuals with protective immunity to self and others is crucial to protect the populations at risk."

They not only produce food but also contribute to economic empowerment by employing large shares of workers, especially in developing countries. The COVID-19 crisis is expected to significantly affect food systems, through both disruptions caused by measures to contain the spread of the disease and the economic downturn it has caused. Food systems at all levels―globally, domestically, locally, and in the home―will feel the impact and need to adjust to new realities.\n\nBoth women and men work as food producers, processors, and traders; however, the different constraints they face lead to gender inequalities disfavoring women. Several inclusive agricultural value chain development and gender-sensitive agricultural programs demonstrate that these inequalities can successfully be reduced (Johnson et al. 2016; Maertens and Verhofstadt 2013; Quisumbing et al. 2015).\n\nShocks or crises can exacerbate or reduce gender gaps, and so can policy responses to mitigate the impact of these crises or shocks. We offer some perspectives and available country examples on how the COVID-19 crisis and responses to the crisis could be a setback or offer opportunities for gender equality in the food system.\n\nModern supply chains During the past three decades, modern supply chains for high-value produce, such as horticulture products for high-income markets, have expanded rapidly across developing countries. They have not only changed the way food is produced and traded in developing countries but also affected the welfare of those engaged in the supply chains (Maertens and Swinnen 2012). Women constitute the majority of the labor force of many of those supply chains, for example in fresh flowers, fresh fruit, and vegetable processing and trading. Although exceptions exist, women’s participation in these modern supply chains has often led to significant increases in women’s income and empowerment. The COVID-19 crisis has already severely affected global value chains and we can expect continued, long-term negative impacts on production and employment in these value chains. These impacts may result in a significant setback for women’s income-generating opportunities and empowerment. Ethiopia’s flower export sector, for example, is at risk of losing 150,000 employees, many of whom are women.1 To avoid this setback, the private sector and governments will need to find options to mitigate short- and long-term impacts. Businesses that are struggling to survive could innovate by diversifying products and shifting production to follow demand. For example, those in the flower sector could use their greenhouses, cold chains, and storage facilities for intensified production of vegetables with high demand locally or elsewhere; they could also venture from agroprocessing into scented sanitizers, perfumes, or other products. Some flower farmers in Kenya are using the Fairtrade Premium to keep workers employed, shifting some production temporarily to produce masks, and intensifying promotion of their product lines to consumers via online platforms.2 And many beer companies have responded to changing demand by shifting their production into hand sanitizers.3 Enterprises that remain in business must adjust practices and adopt precautionary measures to ensure buyer and consumer confidence in both worker and product safety. Enterprises already complying with high quality standards might more easily put in place additional employee health checks, protective gear provision, and sanitation measures. Government can support such diversification and innovation through grants, temporary loan programs, and directed policies. Business support should encourage and explicitly target women-owned companies or those with large shares of women and youth workers. The government of Ethiopia, for example, removed the restriction on the floor price for flower exports to keep companies in business and able to supply any available domestic and international demand for flowers.4 Proactively stimulating demand "

        "full_text": "Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is easily transmitted from person to person, which has fueled the ongoing pandemic. Governments in different countries have taken drastic actions such as complete lockdown. However, little attention has been paid to food safety and its potential linkage with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 spread from staff to food products or food surfaces is conceivable. At least, instead of consuming unpackaged or uncovered foods, consumption of boiled or canned foods processed at high temperatures should be preferred. Before consumption, consumers should clean the surface of canned foods. In addition to recommending or enforcing simple precautions, such as using masks, governments must conduct mandatory SARS-CoV-2 tests regularly and intermittently for personnel who handle food materials or supporting materials (e.g., plastic pouches). Local markets, such as those in Wuhan, which sell live animals and exotic foods for consumption, are a concern. Trade of exotic or wild animals, unhygienic marketplace conditions, and not cooking at high temperatures ought to be prohibited. The consumption of vitamins, minerals, and other food-derived compounds such as omega fatty acids is a prudent way to improve the performance of the immune system. In addition, nano-encapsulated materials with controlled release properties may be useful in protecting food products and packaging from SARS-CoV-2 contamination. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Foodborne viruses, Food safety, Food hygiene, Nanotechnology\n\nIntroduction Humans have for millennia faced many health problems caused by bacterial or viral infections. In particular, bacteria are a major cause of foodborne illnesses. Therefore, studies on foodborne illnesses have focused on bacterial spoilage in food and foodborne pathogens, with comparatively less attention given to viruses. Generally, a virus is defined as an infectious agent that is typically 20–300 nm in size, contains RNA or DNA, and requires a living host cell for its replication. The collective host range of viruses is broad and includes animals, humans, plants, and bacteria [26]. Serious diseases caused by viruses include Ebola, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and avian influenza. The latter two occur globally. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae. Illnesses caused by CoVs include the common cold (caused by HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43), middle east respiratory syndrome (caused by MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (caused by SARS-CoV), and COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 [7, 59]. The latter is the cause of an ongoing pandemic. The name CoV is derived from the Latin word corona, meaning “crown” or “halo” which refers to the characteristic appearance of the virus particles viewed by electron microscopy. CoV is zoonotic, meaning it may pass from animals to humans. This typically occurs when infected animals are slaughtered for consumption. [8, 52, 63]. CoV has been identified in bats, cattle, cats, rats, chickens, turkeys, swine, dogs, rabbits, horses and may cause respiratory tract and gastrointestinal diseases [11, 21, 33, 37, 38, 48]. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain positive-stranded RNA virus covered by a lipid bilayer. The genome identity of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV exceeded 70%. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a cell surface protein that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV can bind with [45, 65]. The common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections are usually pneumonia and fever. However, SARS-CoV-2 has a longer incubation period and is more infectious [45]. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections have all been associated with the consumption and trade of wild animals [17, 28, 30, 43, 63]. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic originated primarily in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [23, 55]. With regard to food consumption and COVID-19, many initial infections were linked to Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale market [6, 8, 22, 23, 28], which was closed on 01 January 2020. Whether the market is the actual source of the illness is unclear. In another opinion, the market might have boosted the circulation of the virus more rapidly rather than being the source of the virus [62]. As the outbreak increased in scope and attained pandemic status, information about the virus was disseminated through various organizations. For example, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released some Frequently Asked Questions related to COVID-19 on its website on 13 March 2020 [13]. Of relevance to this paper, the potential relationship between COVID-19 and food products has received great attention. Some of the examples of questions are: Is food imported to the United States from China and other countries affected by COVID-19 at risk of spreading COVID-19?. Are food products produced in the USA a risk for the spread of COVID-19?. Can COVID-19 be spread by touching SARS-CoV-2-"

We spatially and temporally averaged these data into daily county-level records. SH is the mass of water vapor in a unit mass of moist air (g kg−1). Daily downward UV radiation at the surface, with a wavelength of 0.20–0.44 µm, was extracted from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 climate reanalysis47.\n\nOther characteristics of each county, including geographic location, population density, demographic structure of the population, socioeconomic factors, proportion of healthcare workers, intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity, health risk factors, long-term and short-term air pollution, and climate zone were collected from multiple sources. Geographic coordinates, population density, median household income, percent of people older than 60 years, percent Black residents, percent Hispanic residents, percent owner-occupied housing, percent residents aged 25 years and over without a high school diploma, and percent healthcare practitioners or support staff were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau48. Total ICU beds in each county were derived from Kaiser Health News49. The prevalence of smoking and obesity among adults in each county was obtained from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s 2020 County Health Rankings50. We extracted annual PM 2.5 concentrations in the U.S. from 2014 to 2018 from the 0.01° × 0.01° grid resolution PM 2.5 estimation provided by the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group51, and calculated average PM 2.5 levels during this 5-year period for each county to represent long-term PM 2.5 exposure (Supplementary Fig. 5). Short-term air quality data during the study period, including daily mean PM 2.5 and daily maximum 8-h O 3 , were obtained from the United States Environmental Protection Agency52. We categorized study counties into one of five climate zones based on the guide released by U.S. Department of Energy53 (Supplementary Fig. 6).\n\nThe county-level COVID-19 case and death data were downloaded from the John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center1. The U.S. county-to-county commuting data were available from the U.S. Census Bureau48. Daily numbers of inter-county visitors to points of interest (POI) were provided by SafeGraph54.\n\nData ethics\n\nSafeGraph utilizes data from mobile applications of which users optionally consent to provide their anonymous location data.\n\nEstimation of reproduction number\n\nWe estimated the daily reproduction number (R t ) in all 3142 U.S. counties using a dynamic metapopulation model informed by human mobility data31,55. R t is the mean number of new infections caused by a single infected person, given the public health measures in place, in a population in which everyone is assumed to be susceptible. In the metapopulation model, two types of movement were considered: daily work commuting and random movement. During the daytime, some commuters travel to a county other than their county of residence, where they work and mix with the populations of that county; after work, they return home and mix with individuals in their home, residential county. Apart from regular commuting, a fraction of the population in each county, assumed to be proportional to the number of inter-county commuters, travels for purposes other than work. As the population present in each county is different during daytime and night-time, we modelled the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 separately for these two time periods, each depicted by a set of ordinary differential equations (Supplementary Notes).\n\nTo account for case underreporting, we explicitly simulated reported and unreported infections, for which separate transmission rates were defined. Recent studies from several countries indicate that asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, which are typically unreported, are less contagious than symptomatic cases56,57,58,59. Studies on the early transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in China18 and the U.S.60 also showed that undocumented infections are less transmissible than documented infections.\n\nIn order to reflect the spatiotemporal variation of disease transmission rate and reporting, we allowed transmission rates and ascertainment rates to vary across counties and to change over time. The transmission model simulated daily confirmed cases and deaths for each county. To map infections to deaths, we used an age-stratified infection fatality rate (IFR)61 and computed the weekly IFR for each county as a weighted average using state-level age structure of confirmed cases reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We further adjusted for reporting lags using an observational delay model informed by a U.S. line-list COVID-19 data record62.\n\nFor the period prior to March 15, 2020, we used commuting data from the U.S. census survey to prescribe the inter-county movem"

This study aimed to clarify the impact of hypertension on COVID-19 and investigate whether the prior use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors affects the prognosis of COVID-19. A total of 996 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 282 patients with hypertension and 714 patients without hypertension. Propensity score-matched analysis (1:1 matching) was used to adjust the imbalanced baseline variables between the 2 groups. Patients with hypertension were further divided into the RAAS inhibitor group (n=41) and non-RAAS inhibitor group (n=241) according to their medication history. The results showed that COVID-19 patients with hypertension had more severe secondary infections, cardiac and renal dysfunction, and depletion of CD8+ cells on admission. Patients with hypertension were more likely to have comorbidities and complications and were more likely to be classified as critically ill than those without hypertension. Cox regression analysis revealed that hypertension (hazard ratio, 95% CI, unmatched cohort [1.80, 1.20-2.70]; matched cohort [2.24, 1.36-3.70]) was independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. In addition, hypertensive patients with a history of RAAS inhibitor treatment had lower levels of C-reactive protein and higher levels of CD4+ cells. The mortality of patients in the RAAS inhibitor group (9.8% versus 26.1%) was significantly lower than that of patients in the non-RAAS inhibitor group. In conclusion, hypertension may be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. Patients who previously used RAAS inhibitors may have a better prognosis."

INTRODUCTION The first case of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on December 31, 2019. Until March, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by this virus, has spread around the world. SARS‐CoV‐2 is human coronavirus, which does not belong to the group of benign coronaviruses that cause common cold, but to the smaller group of coronaviruses that cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus—SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus—MERS). 1 , 2 Recently published studies showed that arterial hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were prevalent among the patients with COVID‐19. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 Investigations on the outcome of these patients are scarce, and data are very limited. Nevertheless, hypertension is considered as one of the most important risk factors for COVID‐19. The relationship between hypertension and adverse outcome is still questionable. The aim of this review paper was to summarize current knowledge about the relationship between hypertension and COVID‐19 and the role of hypertension in outcome of these patients. A comprehensive search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and Google scholar, to find review papers on this topic published until May 1, 2020.\n\n2. PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL LINK BETWEEN COVID‐19 AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is triggered when the S‐protein of the virus binds to angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is highly expressed in the heart, lungs, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, and plays an important role in several cardiovascular and immune pathways. 20 SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to ACE2 with much higher affinity compared to SARS‐CoV. 21 Additionally, SARS‐CoV‐2 shows its pathogenic activity by attacking type II alveolar epithelial cells that are expressing ACE2. Previous studies of coronavirus that causes SARS demonstrated that this virus binds to ACE2 in pulmonary alveoli through their superficial spike proteins, which causes lung damage and even lung function failure. 21 The loss of ACE2, caused by binding SARS‐CoV‐2, may shift the system to an overall higher angiotensin II and lower angiotensin‐(1‐7) tone. The role of angiotensin II in COVID‐19 hypertensive patients seems to be crucial due to its role in functioning of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) that promotes vasoconstriction, sodium retention, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis and increases the bioactive peptide angiotensin‐(1‐7). 22\n\n3. PREVALENCE OF HYPERTENSION IN PATIENTS WITH COVID‐19 Epidemiological data coming from China indicate that arterial hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most prevalent concomitant diseases in patients with COVID‐19 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 23 (Table 1). The number of investigations that provided at least short follow‐up with intrahospital outcome is limited. Even though these data demonstrated that the prevalence of hypertension in COVID‐19 patients with lethal outcome was high, 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 14 , 17 it has still been debated whether hypertension was a predictor of mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors (age, obesity, diabetes) and comorbidities (coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascul"

These findings indicate that these comorbidities are not only associated with severity of disease but also predispose for getting Covid-19. Future research is needed to establish the mechanisms involved in each comorbidity and the apparent \"protective\" effect of cigarette smoking."

        "full_text": "Abstract The recently discovered novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus), has brought the whole world to standstill with critical challenges, affecting both health and economic sectors worldwide. Although initially, this pandemic was associated with causing severe pulmonary and respiratory disorders, recent case studies reported the association of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, which is also life-threatening. Several SARS-CoV-2 positive case studies have been reported where there are mild or no symptoms of this virus. However, a selection of patients are suffering from large artery ischemic strokes. Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the cerebrovascular system has not been elucidated yet, researchers have identified several pathogenic mechanisms, including a role for the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to identify the risk factors related to the progression and adverse outcome of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Since many articles have reported the effect of smoking (tobacco and cannabis) and vaping in cerebrovascular and neurological systems, and considering that smokers are more prone to viral and bacterial infection compared to non-smokers, it is high time to explore the probable correlation of smoking in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we have reviewed the possible role of smoking and vaping on cerebrovascular and neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, along with potential pathogenic mechanisms associated with it. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, cerebrovascular, neurological, smoking, CNS, blood-brain barrier\n\n1. Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a recently discovered form of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) [1,2]. The outbreak of this virus first appeared in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019 [3]. On March 11, 2020, it was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) [4]. As of May 28th 2020, a total number of 5,792,874 coronavirus cases, including 357,479 deaths, have been reported all over the world [5]. This virus is spreading among all populations so rapidly that, in just three months, the USA has become the epicenter, having 1,745,803 confirmed cases, including 102,107 deaths. The number of confirmed cases seems to indicate a steady increment over time and these numbers can be forecasted using several mathematical models available for COVID-19 [5,6,7,8]. Coronaviruses belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae (family Coronaviridae; order Nidovirales), containing four genera named, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus [9]. SARS-CoV-2 is a Betacoronavirus closely related to other human pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that also emerged in the 21st century [10]. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped and non-segmented single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus having crown like spikes on the outer surface. The diameter and length of SARS-CoV-2 are about 65–125 nm and 29.9 kb respectively [11,12]. Structure of SARS-CoV-2 consists of 4 major proteins namely, spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein, as well as several non-structural and accessory proteins (see Figure 1). Among all the proteins, the spike (S) protein plays a key role in viral attachment, fusion, entry, and transmission. This S protein is responsible for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell by attaching with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as a receptor and is present in different organs of the body [13,14]. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Illustrative view of the SARC-CoV-2 virus structural components and known modality of viral entry into the cells. The scheme also provides a summary panel of the potential health impact on the human body specific to lung and the CNS. (ACE2: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2, ER: Endoplasmic reticulum) COVID-19 is easily transmitted through saliva droplets or discharge from the nose of an infected person when he/she sneezes or coughs [15,16]. While most of the infected patients will show mild to moderate respiratory distress/illness and recover with or without requiring special treatments, the death toll number is shockingly high compared to other types of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The symptoms include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, tiredness, and aches and pains [2]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have identified some severe symptoms which require emergency medical attention including, but not limited to, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, trouble breathing, inability to wake or stay awake, new confusion, and bluish lips or face [17]. Although COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, recent reports have revealed some neurological and cerebrovascular symptoms associ"

        "full_text": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has made everyone haplessly searching for a cure. Various drugs are being put forth to help alleviate the risk of infection and severity. Among these drugs, cannabis is foraying its way up as a potential remedial therapy, leading to a rapid surge in the sale of cannabis. 1 Cannabis is sold legally in many parts of the world for medical purposes. Cannabinoids include delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), dronabinol, nabilone, and cannabidiol (CBD). These are used for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as an appetite stimulant, for pediatric epilepsy, chronic neuropathic pain, and muscle spasticity.\n\nCannabinoids have also been advocated to have a possible therapeutic role in viral ailments with a pathogenic host inflammatory. COVID-19 triggers a cytokine storm in the body causing hyper inflammation. Coronavirus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor to enter into the alveolar cells of the lungs. Endocannabinoid system (ECS) is associated with the renin angiotensin system and modulates between the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and angiotensin II (AT2) levels.2 Cannabinoids can potentially target the immune pathways and downregulate the cytokine storm. This is the propelling factor of cannabis use in patients suffering from COVID-19. Costiniuk et al.3 and Byrareddy et al.4 have proposed the use of CBD as an anti-inflammatory therapy for patients with COVID-19, as cannabinoids regulate the immune system, have anti-inflammatory properties, and have an effect on cardiovascular function and hypertension.\n\nHowever, this anti-inflammatory activity may not be an advantage when combating viruses because it may mitigate the host immune responses to acute viral and respiratory infections, leading to disease progression and possibly death. Moreover, cannabis smoking is linked with poor respiratory health, immunosuppression, and a higher incidence of stroke in younger individuals. Reece et al.5 reported a higher incidence of coronavirus infection with higher use of cannabis and identified it as a risk factor for COVID-19.\n\nThere are dichotomous effects of cannabinoids on immunocompetence. Although targeting the ECS for anti-inflammatory role in chronic inflammatory conditions may be beneficial, detrimental effects in the case of acute infections may also be a possibility. Using CBD and THC might reduce the immune response to fight off acute infections, which contrasts against it being touted as a potential anti-inflammatory therapy for coronavirus. Hence, the use of cannabinoids should be avoided and stricter laws should be enforced for regulated sale of these products in this pandemic unless taken for recognized indications.\n\nThe ongoing CANDIDATE trial (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT04467918) – CBD is currently in phase 2 for the use of cannabis plus pharmacological and clinical measures in mild to moderate COVID-19. The trial includes a total of 100 participants infected with coronavirus, 50 in placebo and 50 cases in the CBD group. Patients in CBD group will receive 300mg/day for 14 days. The other ongoing trial is OMNI-Can trial (Outcomes Mandate National Integration with Cannabis) (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03944447), which is assessing the efficacy of cannabis for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The trial is assessing the COVID-19 infection rates in cannabis users compared with those in the general population. It also compares the severity of persistent symptoms and antibodies in cannabis users who become COVID positive in a time frame of 5 years. Further multicentric phase 3 trials need to be conducted before making these drugs available as potential treatment for COVID-19."

We aimed to find risk factors for the progression of COVID-19 to help reducing the risk of critical illness and death for clinical help.\n\nMethods: The data of COVID-19 patients until March 20, 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of critical/mortal and non-critical COVID-19 patients with meta-analysis.\n\nResults: Thirteen studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 3027 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male, older than 65, and smoking were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (male: OR = 1.76, 95% CI (1.41, 2.18), P < 0.00001; age over 65 years old: OR =6.06, 95% CI(3.98, 9.22), P < 0.00001; current smoking: OR =2.51, 95% CI(1.39, 3.32), P = 0.0006).

        "full_text": "Abstract Are people drinking more now that they are locked in a house with their nearest and dearest, facing job loss or having lost a job, bored and stressed? Probably. Is drinking a healthy way of coping? No.\n\nBottom Line… Alcohol relieves stress, temporarily, and people are probably using it now — and using too much of it.\n\nAre people drinking more now that they are locked in a house with their nearest and dearest, facing job loss or having lost a job, bored and stressed? Probably. Is drinking a healthy way of coping? No.\n\nThe only real data on drinking and mass stress comes from the work of Deborah S. Hasin, Ph.D., professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, and colleagues on what happened in New York City after 9/11 (the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center). She published three studies, showing that:\n\nthe greater the intensity of exposure to 9/11 (“a more stressful experience,” she explained) plus a past history of drinking problems predicted heavier drinking in the year after the 9/11 attack,\n\npeople with a past history of drinking to cope with stress drank more heavily than others in the year after the attack and\n\nthe intensity of exposure to 9/11 had long‐lasting effects, with greater exposure to the attack associated with binge drinking even five to six years later.\n\n“The bottom line here is that many people do respond to acute stress by drinking heavily,” Hasin told ADAW last week. “Since heavy drinking can adversely affect immune functioning and increase the risk for pneumonia, heavy drinking right now during the COVID‐19 pandemic is really not a good idea.”\n\nMark Willenbring, M.D., founder and CEO of Alltyr in St. Paul, Minnesota, and former director of the Division of Treatment and Recovery Research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, immediately cited Hasin's research on 9/11 when we asked about drinking and stress. “This is absolutely something to work on — boredom, stress, economic distress, those are key precipitants for recurrence” of alcohol use disorder, he said. Is it normal to drink to respond to stress? “I don't think drinking is very normal,” he said.\n\nBut that doesn't mean alcohol should be banned. “We've had prohibition once and it was a disaster,” Willenbring said. “People need access to alcohol,” and this means people with a severe disorder. He added that 20% of people with alcohol use disorder would go into severe withdrawal if the supply were cut off.\n\nLiquor stores, anecdotally, are doing a booming business. Whether this is because bars are closed (except for takeout) or because people are hoarding out of fear that liquor stores will close down is unclear. “People are stocking up on toilet paper too,” said George F. Koob, Ph.D., director of NIAAA, in an interview with ADAW last week. “There's a general hoarding going on just out of general fear that something might not be available.”\n\nLiquor stores We checked with the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS) to find out if people are buying more hard liquor (wine and beer are often sold in grocery stores, so we figured liquor stores would be the target for people who want to hoard or drink what they can't get elsewhere). “We do not have any hard data” on this, said Lisa Hawkins, senior vice president for public affairs at DISCUS. “Walk into any grocery or convenience store and you continue to see aisles that remain bare.” However, she said hoarding behavior is possible, noting that “consumers may be stocking up on food and alcohol products out of concern that their local stores may be shut down for an extended period of time.” She went on to cite the importance of drinking responsibly, noting that the U.S. Dietary Guidelines define moderate drinking as up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. “As people are hunkered down at home isolating, we continue to urge adults who choose to drink to do so responsibly.” (DISCUS has petitioned the government to allow grocery stores to sell distilled spirits, as part of the response to COVID‐19.) Interestingly, most states have decided that liquor stores are necessary businesses, like grocery stores. In New York, they are actually listed in the same category. Except for Pennsylvania, which did shut them down this month (see “Alcohol store closure in Pennsylvania: Withdrawals in future?” ADAW, March 23), they are considered important enough to stay open. We asked the New York State Liquor Authority (SLA) via email whether liquor stores would continue to be essential businesses in the state. “The State Liquor Authority does not make determinations as to whether a business is deemed essential, this is determined by the Empire State Development Corporation,” the SLA responded. They have posted guidance on their website (https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026). “Universal alcohol availability is a socially useful control valve in this time of uncertainty, and given the apparent number of people who are alcohol‐dep"

The aim of the present study was to check the efficacy of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Task Force (TF) on Contact Dermatitis (CD) recommendations in a real life and to search if providing products mentioned in that recommendations may increase its efficacy. Doctors and nurses who worked with patients during COVID‐19 pandemic and use hand disinfectants received adopted recommendations of the EADV TF on CD only or together with mentioned in that recommendations gel with ethanol and glycerin and emollient.

INTRODUCTION Frequency of hand disinfection and adverse skin reactions increased significantly among health care workers after the COVID‐19 outbreak 1 , 2 with up to 97.0% prevalence rate of skin damage caused by enhanced infection‐prevention measures among first‐line health care workers. 3 Several professionals' groups on contact dermatitis presented their consensus recommendations on hand hygiene and adverse cutaneous reactions prevention during COVID‐19 pandemic. 4 , 5 These statements recommend in particular to use alcoholic solutions with glycerin followed by additional regular use of a fragrance‐free emollient. Nurses are often the primary point of care and are predisposed to acquire or transmit infections such as COVID‐19. Their adherence to infection prevention and control guidelines is vital in combatting the current COVID‐19 pandemic. 6 One small pre COVID‐19 study on the hand skin of nurses working in the operating room and a control group of female administrative employees demonstrated that nurses had significantly lower stratum corneum hydration, higher transepidermal water loss and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment. Meanwhile subjective evaluation of skin sensitivity was identical in both groups. 7 Recent study on occupational hand eczema among health care workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic showed that only 14.9% of health care workers actively recognized the symptoms as an onset of the disease. 1 The psychosocial effects of the COVID‐19 pandemic, an increase in contact dermatitis and several other skin diseases because of stress, disinfectants and protective equipment use, especially in health care workers, all contribute to significant HRQoL impairment. 8 The aim of this study was to check HRQoL related to disinfectants use among health care professionals during COVID‐19 pandemic, its differences between nurses and doctors and possibility of its improvement by providing recommendations only vs recommendations and purifying hand gel with ethanol and glycerin and emollient balm.\n\n2. METHODS AND MATERIALS Doctors and nurses from Kiev city, Kiev region, Khmelnytskyi city and Khmelnytskyi region who regularly worked with patients during COVID‐19 pandemic, use hand antiseptics at their working places and did not have to use exact antiseptic type, had no officially registered occupational skin diseases and did not complain on skin diseases were invited to answer questions on age, working experience in medicine, average frequency of antiseptic use per working day, history of redness, fissures, oozing, vesiculation and itch related to hand disinfection (T1).

        "url": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7180684/",
        "full_text": "Abstract The novel coronavirus, since its first outbreak in December, has, up till now, affected approximately 114,542 people across 115 countries. Many international agencies are devoting efforts to enhance the understanding of the evolving COVID-19 outbreak on an international level, its influences, and preparedness. At present, COVID-19 appears to affect individuals through person-to-person means, like other commonly found cold or influenza viruses. It is widely known and acknowledged that viruses causing influenza peak during cold temperatures and gradually subside in the warmer temperature, owing to their seasonality. Thus, COVID-19, due to its regular flu-like symptoms, is also expected to show similar seasonality and subside as the global temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere with the onset of spring. Despite these speculations, however, the systematic analysis in the global perspective of the relation between COVID-19 spread and meteorological parameters is unavailable. Here, by analyzing the region- and city-specific affected global data and corresponding meteorological parameters, we show that there is an optimum range of temperature and UV index strongly affecting the spread and survival of the virus, whereas precipitation, relative humidity, cloud cover, etc. have no effect on the virus. Unavailability of pharmaceutical interventions would require greater preparedness and alert for the effective control of COVID-19. Under these conditions, the information provided here could be very helpful for the global community struggling to fight this global crisis. It is, however, important to note that the information presented here clearly lacks any physiological evidences, which may merit further investigation. Thus, any attempt for management, implementation, and evaluation strategies responding to the crisis arising due to the COVID-19 outbreak must not consider the evaluation presented here as the foremost factor. Keywords: Coronavirus, COVID-19, Temperature, UV index, Non-physiological reaction\n\nIntroduction As of 10th March 2020, 114,814 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (also called COVID-19) infection have been reported worldwide since its emergence in mid-December (Du Toit 2020). Almost 70.3% are being reported from China alone, followed by Italy (8.0%), South Korea (6.5%), Iran (6.2%), France (1.2%), Spain (1%), Germany (1%), the USA (0.6%), and Japan (0.6%), constituting more than ~95% of the total reported confirmed cases. In a report released by the World Health Organization (WHO). a major goal and objective is outlined to rapidly disseminate the national (for China) and international planning on the preparedness in response to the increasing and ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. The virus traces its origin for the recent outbreak in China, when three samples for bronchoalveolar lavage were collected and detailed microbiological analysis confirmed that the virus had typical features resembling the coronavirus family. COVID-19 has a transmission characteristic typical of any other cold-causing influenza virus: human-to-human. As per the report published by the WHO, the common symptoms include fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, etc., which can be recognized as normal flu symptoms. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, extensive efforts have been constantly devoted to improving understanding about the virus. As a result, this virus, previously unknown to many, not only garnered tremendous research attention, but also became a household name within a span of merely 90 days. The outbreak has also brought many major cities in China to a standstill and resulted in the isolation of a large number of citizens in Italy. Such a curfew-like situation can be difficult to impose and may not yield the desired results under many circumstances (Fong et al. 2020), which is evident from the steps being taken by countries to contain further spread of the virus. At the same time, another prevalent issue is considering the COVID-19 features that are similar to common influenza viruses causing colds. The most common feature of common influenza viruses is seasonality, which implies that, during colder temperatures, influenza caused by viruses increases, which then subside with the warming of air temperature. This assumption, at this moment, is not backed by any robust analysis and scientific investigations. Under the circumstances of unobtainability of any pharmaceutical relief to treat the COVID-19 virus, specific information about the non-physiological causes augmenting the survival and spread of COVID-19 can be very valuable information for policy-makers dealing with management and effective control measures. Since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, a lot of attention has been paid to understanding cross-species transmission (Ji et al. 2020), efforts regarding the discovery, emergence, clinical diagnostic, and genomic characteristics of COVID-"

        "full_text": "Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a severe public health issue. The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases. However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the range from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Each 1 °C rise of temperature was associated with a −4.8951% (t = −2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the results of the model. The predicted R-squared of the polynomial linear regression model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8 °C to 27.4 °C. Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the number of confirmed cases. The curve flattened at a threshold of 25.8 °C. There is no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8 °C. The study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers. Keywords: Tropical temperature, COVID-19, Brazil, Generalized additive model, Transmission\n\nGraphical abstract Open in a new tab\n\nHighlights • The dose-response relationships suggest that the relationship between the annual average of temperature compensation and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of less than 25.8°C, which became flat above 25.8°C.\n\n• When the average temperature was below 25.8°C, each 1°C rise was associated with a −4.8951% (t = −2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19.\n\n• There is no evidence supporting that case counts of COVID-19 could decline when the weather becomes warmer, in temperatures is above 25.8°C.\n\n• The polynomial (cubic) regression model can give insights to other researchers for testing new factors and revealing new determinants capable of fitting the trend regression to a maximum of R-squared in COVID-19 cases.\n\n2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The study included 27 cities, all state capitals of Brazil, covering longitudes from 34° 51′ 40″ W to 67° 48′ 27″ W and latitude from 8° 45′ 43″ N to 30° 1′ 40″ S. Fig. 1 (adapted from Alvares et al., 2014) shows the Koppen climate types of Brazil (adapted by the authors). In Brazil, 93% of the landmass is in the Southern Hemisphere, and the remainder (7%) is in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that the territory is in the tropical zone of the planet, except for the southern region, below the Tropic of Capricorn, corresponding to 6.76% of the Brazilian territory. Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Map of Brazil country, with tropical and subtropical climates. 2.2. Data collection The study population is the daily number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the 27 state capital cities, as officially reported by the Ministry of Health of Brazil from February 27 to April 1, 2020. This work focused on the capital cities because of the land cover of Brazilian territory and the few cases to date in the interior of the Brazilian states. Meteorological data were collected from the National Institute of Meteorology authority in Brazil. Meteorological data were limited and did not include all cities in Brazil. Demographic density and estimated population were collected from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the official provider of geographic and statistical information of Brazil. 2.3. Statistical analysis A descriptive analysis was performed, with numerical variables described using means, standard deviations, and distributions. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to calculate the relationships between the temperature data and the number of cumulative total confirmed cases (lgN), respectively, to fit equations and splines. GAM fits generalized additive models (Liu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2018) for parametric and nonparametric regression and smoothing. GAM can be useful to explore linear and nonlinear weather effects and health outcomes (Zhu and Xie, 2020). The model defined is semiparametri"

        "full_text": "Abstract The 2020 coronavirus pandemic is developing at different paces throughout the world. Some areas, like the Caribbean Basin, have yet to see the virus strike at full force. When it does, there is reasonable evidence to suggest the consequent COVID‐19 outbreaks will overwhelm healthcare systems and economies. This is particularly concerning in the Caribbean as pandemics can have disproportionately higher mortality impacts on lower and middle‐income countries. Preliminary observations from our team and others suggest that temperature and climatological factors could influence the spread of this novel coronavirus, making spatiotemporal predictions of its infectiousness possible. This review studies geographic and time‐based distribution of known respiratory viruses in the Caribbean Basin in an attempt to foresee how the pandemic will develop in this region. This review is meant to aid in planning short‐ and long‐term interventions to manage outbreaks at the international, national, and subnational levels in the region. Keywords: coronavirus, pandemic, seasonal incidence\n\nHighlights Inter‐tropical regions have seen a slower spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 compared to temperate ones, suggesting viral spreading could likely be influenced by environmental factors.\n\nOther coronaviruses also seem to respond to environmental factors, with peaks closely following the geotemporal patterns of influenza.\n\nIn the Caribbean, timing interventions to fight COVID‐19 around the projected peaks of influenza is a reasonable public health approach.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION On 12 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus, the pathogen responsible for the clinical disease known as COVID‐19. Governments worldwide have been putting in place measures to limit the spread of the disease, but recent publications 1 , 2 suggest the pandemic could last up to 18 months. If so, it will be necessary to layer interventions. The reactive control measures employed so far have failed to control the crisis. Countries will have to choose paths of action going forth including a proactive, preventative approach to COVID‐19 outbreaks. Proactive planning is challenging when so little is known about SARS‐CoV‐2. Nevertheless, there is reason to believe the disease will have a predictable spatiotemporal spread based on environmental factors, particularly weather. 3 , 4 This knowledge can help countries and regions put measures in place at key points, as is done, for example, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for susceptible populations. 5 Influenza epidemics are likewise treated prophylactically with vaccines for the general population 6 plus social distancing interventions during seasonal peaks. 7 , 8 Similar interventions might work if this novel coronavirus does prove to be seasonal. While understanding the geotemporal distribution of the pathogen could help citizens, institutions, and governments in mitigation, preparation, and response, it is important to note that spatiotemporal behavior of respiratory pathogens is not equally documented in all regions. This is particularly important in areas where SARS‐CoV‐2 has only recently been introduced, like the Caribbean Basin—the land areas bordering the Caribbean Sea. This region notoriously has high variability for data on the infectious patterns of respiratory viruses. An individual and community approach from the Caribbean nations, if implemented soon, could significantly curve the impact of COVID‐19 epidemics in that area. This review puts forth several observations on why SARS‐CoV‐2 might exhibit a geotemporal pattern, what could be expected if the virus becomes endemic, and what actions might help manage the current crisis.\n\n2. VIROLOGY OF CORONAVIRUSES Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is within the taxonomical family coronaviridae. This family of viruses has an envelope, a nucleocapsid, and a positive‐sense, single‐stranded RNA genome. 9 SARS‐CoV‐2 is classified into the genus Betacoronavirus, one of four genera within this family. 10 , 11 Genome sequencing analyses showed that SARS‐CoV‐2 is ~30k nucleotides in size, containing a single long open reading frame at the 5′ terminal encoding viral replicase/transcriptase and several reading frames for structural proteins towards the 3′ terminal, including envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and spike (S) protein. 11 , 12 The surface‐located trimeric S glycoprotein is the key determinant of viral host specificity, as it initiates infection by mediating receptor‐recognition and membrane fusion. 13 , 14 , 15 Notably, the S gene of SARS‐CoV‐2 is highly divergent from other SARS‐related coronaviruses, with less than 75% nucleotide sequence identity. 11 , 16 Despite significant differences in the S gene sequence, SARS‐CoV‐2 uses the same receptor as SARS‐CoV: angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2. 11 , 17 This sug"

        "full_text": "Abstract Despite the burden of disease of CVD and DM, there is a lack of experimentally validated literature exploring their association with exacerbation of COVID-19. Target receptors of medications commonly used to treat CVD and DM may be involved in the viral entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. We propose the potential protective effects of these medications in COVID-19 infections, highlighting the need for further research. Firstly, AMPK mediated phosphorylation of ACE-2 by metformin as well as the drug’s alkaline properties may interrupt the natural disease progression. Secondly, DPP4 receptor involvement in the putative viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 may be prevented by DPP4i. Finally, recent studies have shown that statins’ ability to inhibit the cytokine storm may outweigh concerns of statin mediated ACE-2 upregulation in COVID-19. The complex interplay of factors affecting CVD and DM in COVID-19 patients makes the direct effects of medications difficult to examine. Therefore, further research is needed, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and the molecular pathways it exploits, to potentially repurpose such pre-existing drugs for their use in COVID-19. Keywords: CVD, Diabetes, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Drug repurposing\n\nThe literature surrounding the association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) with SARS-CoV-2 is sparse. Roy et al. propose multiple pathways to explain these complex relationships. There are two aspects pertaining to CVD; firstly, the concept that SARS-CoV-2 can propagate the development of CVD, and secondly, pre-existing CVD can exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infections, increasing the incidence of cardiac complications. In DM, immune dysfunction increases susceptibility to severe COVID-19 infection [1]. Due to the lack of a vaccine, or targeted therapy for COVID-19, there is an urgent need for further research into potential pharmacological therapies. We propose that patients with these common comorbidities are likely on medications, which may offer protection against severe infections. This may be achieved through the drugs’ action on target receptors of SARS-CoV-2. It is crucial to identify interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with commonly used drugs, including metformin, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i) and statins, with the potential to repurpose them to prevent disease progression.\n\nRoy et al. suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) plays a key role in the severity of disease for COVID-19 patients. Its upregulation in patients with DM makes them more susceptible to complications [1]. We propose that metformin, the first-line treatment for DM, may have protective effects against the virus. Sharma et al. explain that metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) leading to ACE2 phosphorylation. Theoretically, this may induce a conformational change in ACE2, making it less able to bind to SARS-CoV-2 [2]. Following infiltration of the host cells, SARS-CoV-2 downregulates ACE2 receptors leading to pro-inflammatory repercussions, via the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). As metformin activates AMPK and further downstream ACE2, it may prevent SARS-CoV-2-mediated ACE2 downregulation [2]. Additionally, Esam highlights the use of metformin in reversing lung fibrosis and provides insight into its alkaline properties. The suggestion is that the basic nature of metformin may neutralize acidic, SARS-CoV-2-containing vesicles [3]. Although the mechanisms employed by metformin may prove to be protective against severe infection, further research is required to confirm these hypotheses.\n\nSimilar to ACE2, conditions with DPP4 upregulation are associated with severe COVID-19. These include old age, obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and COPD [4]. Roy et al. emphasize the role of ACE2 in viral entry [1]; however, modelling has shown that DPP4 may be a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into respiratory tract cells via S1 spike protein interaction [4]. Gliptins, which are DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i), are cardioprotective in CKD and have anti-inflammatory properties [4]. Contrary to Roy et al.’s suggestion that DPP4i may worsen COVID-19 progression [1], the co-receptor hypothesis suggests that DPP4i may actually have a protective effect [4]. It is possible that ACE inhibitors, which increase ACE2 expression in diabetics, may mask this protective effect in patients using the combination of ACEi and DPP4i. However, gliptins do not bind to the suggested binding site of SARS-CoV-2, meaning that the wealth of data surrounding DPP4 may serve a basis for the development of new drugs, as opposed to a direct repurposing of DPP4i for treatment of COVID-19 [4]. Since specific gliptins show different effects in rodent models, further studies are needed to identify the type of DPP4i with the greatest therapeutic potential in COVID-19. Although validation of the role of DPP4 is needed, current models suggest that cells co-expressing ACE2 and DPP4 could provide targets for antiviral therapy [4].\n"

Methods We compared clinical and laboratory results from 719 influenza and 973 COVID-19 patients from January to April 2020. We compiled laboratory results from the first 14 days of the hospitalized patients using parameters that are most significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza and hierarchically clustered COVID-19 patients. Findings Compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited a continued increase in white blood cell count, rapid decline of hemoglobin, more rapid increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and D-dimer, and higher level of alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. COVID-19 patients were sub-classified into 5 clusters through a hierarchical clustering analysis. Medical records were reviewed and patients were risk stratified based on the clinical outcomes. The cluster with the highest risk showed 27·8% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively.

Evidence before this study We searched PubMed and Google Scholar on May 15, 2020 using keywords “COVID-19, influenza” without restrictions of time or language. There were no studies directly comparing the clinical and laboratory courses between western patients with COVID-19 and influenza. One study compared COVID-19 and influenza patients at presentation in China. We next searched “risk stratifications, COVID-19, laboratory results”. Many studies reported risk factors associated with COVID-19 using clinical outcomes as end points. There were no studies using hierarchical clustering approach to stratify laboratory data to predict risks in correlation with clinical outcomes. Added value of this study We report one of the first comparative studies between COVID-19 and influenza patients in the United States on the temporal changes of laboratory results. We also used a unique hierarchical clustering analysis through laboratory data that are distinctive between COVID-19 and influenza and revealed 5 different COVID-19 risk clusters. This approach could be useful to prospectively stratify risk groups and predict pathophysiology in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Implications of all the available evidence There were significant clinical and laboratory differences between COVID-19 and influenza over the course of hospitalization. These differences, combined with risk stratification following temporal changes of laboratory results, are important for differential diagnosis and prognosis of patients with severe viral respiratory infections. Future research on the studies of pathophysiology of different COVID-19 risk clusters would be helpful to understand the disease. Alt-text: Unlabelled box\n\n1. Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly disseminated in most countries. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a novel beta-coronavirus with phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV [1]. To this date, in mid May 2020, the virus has infected over four million individuals worldwide and has claimed close to 300,000 lives. The mortality has been predominantly attributed to progressive pneumonia, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other organ failures and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 has been observed in many studies, particularly in the hospitalized patients [2–4]. The pandemic of COVID-19 overlaps with 2019-2020 flu season, which makes it difficult to differentially diagnose and manage patients with acute respiratory symptoms. Currently published clinical and laboratory data on COVID-19 are largely limited to studies with small sample size and mostly originated from China. Studies on temporal tracking of laboratory results in correlation with the severity of the disease are scarce. The most commonly reported laboratory abnormalities in COVID-19 include lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [3]. A study showed that a predictive model using laboratory values had a stronger discriminatory power predicting mortality in hospitalized patients compared to the clinical models [5].

        "full_text": "Recent announcements indicated, without sharing any distinct published set of results, that the corticosteroid dexamethasone may reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients only. The recent Coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2]-associated multiorgan disease, called COVID-19, has high morbidity and mortality due to autoimmune destruction of the lungs stemming from the release of a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Defense against this Corona virus requires activated T cells and specific antibodies. Instead, cytokines are responsible for the serious sequelae of COVID-19 that damage the lungs. Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid approved by the FDA 1958 as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressor and it is about 30 times as active and with longer duration of action (2-3 days) than cortisone. Dexamethasone would limit the production of and damaging effect of the cytokines, but will also inhibit the protective function of T cells and block B cells from making antibodies, potentially leading to increased plasma viral load that will persist after a patient survives SARS. Moreover, dexamethasone would block macrophages from clearing secondary, nosocomial, infections. Hence, dexamethasone may be useful for the short-term in severe, intubated, COVID-19 patients, but could be outright dangerous during recovery since the virus will not only persist, but the body will be prevented from generating protective antibodies. Instead, a pulse of intravenous dexamethasone may be followed by administration of nebulized triamcinolone (6 times as active as cortisone) to concentrate in the lungs only. These corticosteroids could be given together with the natural flavonoid luteolin because of its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, especially its ability to inhibit mast cells, which are the main source of cytokines in the lungs. At the end, we should remember that \"The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease\" [Sir William Osler's (1849-1919)]."

        "full_text": "Rationale: In life-threatening coronavirus disease (COVID-19), corticosteroids reduce mortality, suggesting that immune responses have a causal role in death. Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct reaction to the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or an independent immunopathologic process is unknown.Objectives: To determine SARS-CoV-2 organotropism and organ-specific inflammatory responses and the relationships among viral presence, inflammation, and organ injury.Methods: Tissue was acquired from 11 detailed postmortem examinations. SARS-CoV-2 organotropism was mapped by using multiplex PCR and sequencing, with cellular resolution achieved by in situ viral S (spike) protein detection. Histologic evidence of inflammation was quantified from 37 anatomic sites, and the pulmonary immune response was characterized by using multiplex immunofluorescence.Measurements and Main Results: Multiple aberrant immune responses in fatal COVID-19 were found, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, and these were not clearly topologically associated with the virus. Inflammation and organ dysfunction did not map to the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein between or within tissues. An arteritis was identified in the lung, which was further characterized as a monocyte/myeloid-rich vasculitis, and occurred together with an influx of macrophage/monocyte-lineage cells into the pulmonary parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticuloendothelial responses, including excessive reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages, were present and dissociated from viral presence in lymphoid tissues.Conclusions: Tissue-specific immunopathology occurs in COVID-19, implicating a significant component of the immune-mediated, virus-independent immunopathologic process as a primary mechanism in severe disease. Our data highlight novel immunopathologic mechanisms and validate ongoing and future efforts to therapeutically target aberrant macrophage and plasma-cell responses as well as promote pathogen tolerance in COVID-19."

        "full_text": "Infection by coronavirus (CoV-19) has led to emergence of a pandemic called as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) that has so far affected about 210 countries. The dynamic data indicate that the pandemic by CoV-19 so far has infected 2,403,963 individuals, and among these 624,698 have recovered while, it has been fatal for 165,229. Without much experience, currently, the medicines that are clinically being evaluated for COVID-19 include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, lopinavir, ritonavir, tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Therefore, countries such as Italy, USA, Spain and France with the most advanced health care system are partially successful to control CoV-19 infection. India being the 2nd largest populous country, where, the healthcare system is underdeveloped, major portion of population follow unhygienic lifestyle, is able to restrict the rate of both infection and death of its citizens from COVID-19. India has followed an early and a very strict social distancing by lockdown and has issued advisory to clean hands regularly by soap and/or by alcohol based sterilizers. Rolling data on the global index of the CoV infection is 13,306, and the index of some countries such as USA (66,148), Italy (175,055), Spain (210,126), France (83,363) and Switzerland (262,122) is high. The index of India has remained very low (161) so far, mainly due to early implementation of social lockdown, social distancing, and sanitizing hands. However, articles on social lockdown as a preventive measure against COVID-19 in PubMed are scanty. It has been observed that social lockdown has also drastic impacts on the environment especially on reduction of NO 2 and CO 2 emission. Slow infection rate under strict social distancing will offer time to researchers to come up with exact medicines/vaccines against CoV-19. Therefore, it is concluded that stringent social distancing via lockdown is highly important to control COVID-19 and also to contribute for self-regeneration of nature."

        "full_text": "The coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, is presently responsible for a global pandemic wherein more than 3.5 million people have been infected and more than 250,000 killed to-date. There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, leaving governments and public health agencies with little defense against the virus aside from advising or enforcing best practices for virus transmission prevention, which include hand-washing, physical distancing, use of face covers, and use of effective disinfectants. In this study, a novel iodine complex called CupriDyne® was assessed for its ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. CupriDyne was shown to be effective in inactivating the virus in a time-dependent manner, reducing virus titers by 99% (2 logs) after 30 minutes, and reducing virus titers to below the detection limit after 60 minutes. The novel iodine complex tested herein offers a safe and gentle alternative to conventional disinfectants for use on indoor and outdoor surfaces.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBeginning in December of 2019, the novel coronavirus known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic wherein over 3.5 million people have been infected, and over 250,000 people have died of the disease known as COVID-19 as of May, 2020 (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020). First identified in patients in Wuhan City in Hubei province, China (Lu et al, 2020), COVID-19 causes symptoms including a dry cough, fever, shortness of breath and sore throat (CDC, 2020), and in severe cases can cause severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, organ failure, and death (Chen et al, 2020). The pandemic has spread to over 180 countries, with most governments enacting unprecedented restrictions on movement and assembly of people to curb the growth of the pandemic. Currently, there is no vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19.\n\nPublic health organizations have provided guidance on best practices to limit the spread of COVID-19, which include frequent hand washing, physical distancing, the use of face covers, and the use of effective cleaners and disinfectants to decontaminate surfaces (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2020). In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has created a list of registered disinfectants that meet its criteria for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (US EPA, 2020).\n\nBroadly, the most common disinfectant used against the SARS-CoV-2 is diluted bleach, a widely available and highly effective viral disinfectant. Bleach has several downsides when considered for widespread use including common irritation of skin, mucosal membranes, and airways, its instability when exposed to light, and its high degree of reactivity with organic material (WHO, 2014). Other common disinfectants such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are also effective and widely available, but also have downsides such as flammability, rate of evaporation, and skin sensitivity (Stanford, 2020). In light of these disadvantages, there is a need to develop new disinfectants that are effective against SARS-CoV-2 but which do not cause sensitivity or irritation issues among exposed people, and which can provide long-lasting efficacy.\n\nIodine-containing disinfectants have been used since the mid-19th century (Sneader, 2005), and today iodine complexes such as povidone-iodine (PVP-I) are used in diverse applications that include surgical antiseptic, skin disinfection, and water disinfection (Durani and Leaper, 2008). While traditional Lugol’s iodine or iodine tinctures (wherein elemental iodine is dissolved in water or alcohol, respectively) are effective yet cytotoxic disinfectants, povidone-iodine complexes provide effective disinfection without significant cytotoxicity due to the slow release of iodine from the polyvinylpyrrolidone with which iodine is complexed. However, povidone-iodine causes noticeable staining of skin and surfaces and commonly causes skin irritancy (WHO, 2008), making it an unpopular hard surface disinfectant. Mechanistically, iodine is believed to react with and inactivate bacteria and viruses by oxidizing and/or iodinating critical proteins, DNA, RNA, and fatty acids (Gottardi, 1999; Gottardi, 2014). Iodine-containing solutions have been proven effective against a wide variety of viruses including influenza A, poliovirus, adenovirus type 3, mumps, and HIV (Wada et al, 2016; Kawana et al, 1997), with some indication of greater viricidal spectrum of activity compared to other commercially available disinfectants.\n\nIodine-containing solutions have historically been employed against other respiratory virus infection outbreaks. In 2006, PVP-I was used to inactivate the SARS coronavirus of the so-called SARS epidemic to below detectable levels in a laboratory study (Kariwa et al, 2006), and it was demonstrated effective against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015 (Eggers et al, 2015). Limited evidence also suggests iodine was successfully used "

        "full_text": "Abstract Objective: To analyze the characteristics of YouTube videos in Spanish on the basic measures to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: On 18 March 2020, a search was conducted on YouTube using the terms “Prevencion Coronavirus” and “Prevencion COVID-19”. We studied the associations between the type of authorship and the country of publication with other variables (such as the number of likes and basic measures to prevent COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization, among others) with univariate analysis and a multiple logistic regression model. Results: A total of 129 videos were evaluated; 37.2% were produced in Mexico (25.6%) and Spain (11.6%), and 56.6% were produced by mass media, including television and newspapers. The most frequently reported basic preventive measure was hand washing (71.3%), and the least frequent was not touching the eyes, nose, and mouth (24.0%). Hoaxes (such as eating garlic or citrus to prevent COVID-19) were detected in 15 videos (10.9%). In terms of authorship, papers produced by health professionals had a higher probability of reporting hand hygiene (OR (95% CI) = 4.20 (1.17–15.09)) and respiratory hygiene (OR (95% CI) = 3.05 (1.22–7.62)) as preventive measures. Conclusion: Information from YouTube in Spanish on basic measures to prevent COVID-19 is usually not very complete and differs according to the type of authorship. Our findings make it possible to guide Spanish-speaking users on the characteristics of the videos to be viewed in order to obtain reliable information. Keywords: coronavirus, COVID-19, YouTube, information, prevention, World Health Organization\n\n1. Introduction Internet access has increased worldwide in recent years. By the end of 2017, 3.58 billion people were online, equivalent to 48.0% of the global population [1]. YouTube is the second most visited website and the second biggest search engine in the world [2]. In particular, YouTube, with more than one billion users worldwide and more than 100 million videos, is becoming an increasingly important source of health information [1,3], and it has the capacity to influence its users (for example, regarding their vaccination habits [3] or patient decision-making regarding screening and prevention on colorectal cancer [4] or buying a drug [5]). However, it has no policy of filtering videos according to their potency or effectiveness; for this reason, there are many videos online, and while some may be useful, others may be misleading [6]. In this context, infodemiological studies are becoming increasingly necessary, since they can provide valuable insights into health-related behaviors of populations. Infodemiology is the science of distribution and determinants of information on the Internet or in a population, and it has the aim of informing public health and public policy [7]. Examples of infodemiology applications include the identification and monitoring of public-health-relevant publications on the Internet, measuring information diffusion, and analyzing how people search and navigate on the Internet for health-related information as well as how they communicate and share this information [7,8]. During the previous Zika [9] and Ebola [10,11] public health emergencies, YouTube videos on such infections were viewed millions of times [9,10,11]. This extraordinary audience makes YouTube a double-edged sword in times of epidemic crises, because while appropriate YouTube content can benefit health organizations in ensuring that the population properly implements measures to control the spread of the disease, misleading videos can contribute to failure to contain the infection [12]. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) considered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to have a pandemic status [13]. According to the WHO situation reports, as of 18 March 2020, 191,127 cases had been confirmed worldwide, of which 11,178 were in Spain and 701 cases were in 16 Spanish-speaking countries of America [14]. As in other similar situations, people wanted to know what they could do to prevent and treat the disease [15]. Since there is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, the application of basic preventive measures is essential [16]. The objective of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of the YouTube videos that provide information in Spanish on the basic measures for preventing COVID-19.\n\n2. Material and Methods On 18 March 2020, a cross-sectional study of the data was conducted by entering the terms “Prevencion Coronavirus” and “Prevencion COVID-19” into the YouTube search engine. The videos were sorted according to the number of views, and their full names and URLs were recorded. After applying the exclusion criteria (not available for viewing, language other than Spanish, not providing information on COVID-19, and duplicate video), the 129 most viewed videos were selected. This sample size was estimated from the total number of videos that met "

So far, there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19), and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related coronavirus (SARS‐CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV), and Influenza virus. In this article, we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to patients with COVID‐19. Cathepsin L is required for entry of the 2019‐nCoV virus into the cell as target teicoplanin inhibits virus replication. Angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme 2 (ACE2) in soluble form as a recombinant protein can prevent the spread of coronavirus by restricting binding and entry. In patients with COVID‐19, hydroxychloroquine decreases the inflammatory response and cytokine storm, but overdose causes toxicity and mortality. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019‐nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS‐CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID‐19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS‐CoV. Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory symptoms. Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS‐CoV reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids. Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID‐19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.

HISTORY Looking at the major pandemics of respiratory viruses, we are mainly exposed to the influenza virus, the pandemics that occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009, and various theories predict that the next pandemic of this category of respiratory infections will occur between 2020 and 2050 and be capable of causing a human epidemic (Holmes, 2013). Seasonal influenza is primarily an upper respiratory disease that recurs in different forms each year. The “flu shot” or annual vaccine is the best way to prevent the flu, and all high‐risk healthcare workers are advised to be vaccinated every year. But sometimes more dangerous and even deadly forms occur that are likely to lead to epidemics and pandemics (Andrews, 2006). In late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, several patients were diagnosed with viral pneumonia, now known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019‐nCoV). Subsequently, a large number of cases of the disease were found to either reside in Wuhan or travel to the city. The researchers were able to obtain the 2019‐nCoV genome sequence by performing bronchoalveolar lavage and culture of patients' lungs and by conducting phylogenetic analyzes of the genome and investigating the evolutionary relationship between 2019‐nCoV and other coronaviruses, they found the origin of 2019‐nCoV and its evolutionary history. The 2019‐nCoV genomic sequence obtained from the patients showed that 98.99% of their gene sequences matched. The genome also has an 88% similarity to the genome of the bat‐SL‐CoVZC45 and bat‐SL‐CoVZXC21 bat coronavirus genomes that appeared in Zh"

        "full_text": "The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is quite variable and the manifestations varies from asymptomatic disease to severe acute respiratory infection. Fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, loss of appetite, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are the most prevalent general symptoms. Decreased immune system cells such as suppressed regulatory T cells, cytotoxic and helper T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages and increased proinflammatory cytokines are the characteristic features. Compounds derived from Allium sativum (garlic) have the potential to decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and to reverse the immunological abnormalities to more acceptable levels. Allium sativum is suggested as a beneficial preventive measure before being infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Allium sativum is a functional food well-known for its immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antimutagenic, antitumor properties. Its antiviral efficiency was also demonstrated. Some constituents of this plant were found to be active against protozoan parasites. Within this context, it appears to reverse most immune system dysfunctions observed in patients with COVID-19 infection. The relations among immune system parameters, leptin, leptin receptor, adenosin mono phosphate-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma have also been interpreted. Leptin's role in boosting proinflammatory cytokines and in appetite decreasing suggest the possible beneficial effect of decreasing the concentration of this proinflammatory adipose tissue hormone in relieving some symptoms detected during COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, Allium sativum may be an acceptable preventive measure against COVID-19 infection to boost immune system cells and to repress the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines as well as an adipose tissue derived hormone leptin having the proinflammatory nature."

Human behavior and knowledge assessment during the crisis are critical in the overall efforts to contain the outbreak. To assess knowledge, attitude, perceptions, and precautionary measures toward COVID-19 among a sample of medical students in Jordan. This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted between the 16th and 19th of March 2020. Participants were students enrolled in different levels of study at the six medical schools in Jordan. An online questionnaire which was posted on online platforms was used. The questionnaire consisted of four main sections: socio-demographics, sources of information, knowledge attitudes, and precautionary measures regarding COVID-19. Medical students used mostly social media (83.4%) and online search engines (84.8%) as their preferred source of information on COVID-19 and relied less on medical search engines (64.1%). Most students believed that hand shaking (93.7%), kissing (94.7%), exposure to contaminated surfaces (97.4%), and droplet inhalation (91.0%) are the primary mode of transmission but were indecisive regarding airborne transmission with only 41.8% in support. Participants also reported that elderly with chronic illnesses are the most susceptible group for the coronavirus infection (95.0%). As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic more than 80.0% of study participants adopted social isolation strategies, regular hand washing, and enhanced personal hygiene measures as their first line of defense against the virus. In conclusion, Jordanian medical students showed expected level of knowledge about the COVID-19 virus and implemented proper strategies to prevent its spread.\n\nJordan, similar to other countries in the world, is suffering from an increasing number of COVID-19, which have invited the government to enforce martial law leading to a national curfew on March 21st, 2020. As of May 25th, the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections was 711 cases and 9 related deaths ( www.corona.moh.gov.jo ). Jordan has six medical schools spread across the country with more than 10,000 enrolled students currently under training. Despite major closure of public universities, several medical students are actively volunteering in their communities and local hospital to provide medical assistance and guidance to the public. Accordingly, measuring the levels of knowledge and attitude in the medical student subpopulation is invited. This study represents the first evaluation of COVID-19 outbreak's knowledge, attitudes, and precautionary measures amongst medical students in Jordan.\n\nMultiple studies have emerged assessing the virologic characteristics and clinical consequences of COVID-19 ( 15 , 16 ); however, not enough studies focused on exploring the knowledge, perceived severity and controllability of the COVID-19 among the communities living this pandemic. The knowledge and behavior assessment of the public toward such outbreaks is essential, especially due to the large amount of misconceptions and false information that are circulating on social media in regard to transmission of the disease and methods of acquisition ( 17 ). This is of importance to healthcare professionals, service providers and medical sciences students. Such assessments have proven useful as an important means in the education and raising awareness of best practice in previous viral outbreaks including SARS, MERS, and Ebola ( 18 – 20 ).\n\nIn 2020, a new global pandemic has emerged, caused by a new strain of CoV called SARS-CoV-2. This pandemic started in Wuhan, China in December 2019, possibly due to cross-species transmission ( 10 ), and involved almost every country in the world causing mostly mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and in a minority of cases lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) called coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) ( 11 , 12 ). As of May 25th, 2020, more than 5,305,000 cases were reported and more than 342,000 deaths with a case fatality rate of 6.4% ( 13 ). The SARS-CoV-2 virus is different from its previous predecessors in that it is highly contagious and easily transmitted from human to human via respiratory droplets and direct contact which led to this enormous number of infected people ( 14 ). The day-to-day numbers are still on the rise especially in Europe, and the magnitude of rising numbers of new cases and deaths is hitting the global population hard.\n\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Nidovirales order of the Coronaviridae family that are positive-sense single stranded non-segmented RNA viruses. CoVs are divided based on their antigenicity into four groups: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta CoVs ( 1 , 2 ). All four groups infect primarily mammals and birds and are associated with deadly illnesses that greatly impacted poultry industry ( 3 ). Alpha- and beta-CoVs infect humans as well and cause a wide variety "

Wearing medical masks (MMs) or N95 masks ([N95Ms] namely N95 respirators) can slow the virus spread and reduce the infection risk. Reuse of these masks can minimize waste, protect the environment, and help solve the current imminent shortage of masks. Disinfection of used masks is needed for their reuse with safety, but improper decontamination can damage the blocking structure of masks. In this study, we demonstrated using the avian coronavirus of infectious bronchitis virus to mimic SARS-CoV-2 that MMs and N95Ms retained their blocking efficacy even after being steamed on boiling water for 2 hours. We also demonstrated that three brands of MMs blocked over 99% viruses in aerosols. The avian coronavirus was completely inactivated after being steamed for 5 minutes. Altogether, this study suggested that MMs are adequate for use on most social occasions and both MMs and N95Ms can be reused for a few days with steam decontamination between use."

        "full_text": "In the context of Coronavirus Disease (2019) (COVID-19) cases globally, there is a lack of consensus across cultures on whether wearing face masks is an effective physical intervention against disease transmission. This study 1) illustrates transmission routes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); 2) addresses controversies surrounding the mask from perspectives of attitude, effectiveness, and necessity of wearing the mask with evidence that the use of mask would effectively interrupt the transmission of infectious diseases in both hospital settings and community settings; and 3) provides suggestion that the public should wear the mask during COVID-19 pandemic according to local context. To achieve this goal, government should establish a risk adjusted strategy of mask use to scientifically publicize the use of masks, guarantee sufficient supply of masks, and cooperate for reducing health resources inequities.\n\nWith the increasing number of Coronavirus Disease (2019) (COVID-19) cases globally, countries have utilized precautionary measures against this pandemic. However, there is a lack of consensus across cultures on whether wearing face masks is an effective physical intervention against disease transmission. This study aims to illustrate transmission routes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), address the controversies surrounding mask wearing, and provides suggestions for the use of facial masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe references search was conducted on March 11, using three databases (PubMed, CNKI, and Web of Science) with the search terms “COVID-19”, “2019-nCoV”, “novel coronavirus”, or “SARS-CoV-2” and “mask”, “facial mask”, or “face mask”. The team members individually assessed the relevance and validity of each study. Non-peer reviewed manuscripts from preprint servers were not considered. We also searched the reference lists of the studies included. Findings from the included studies were summarized narratively.\n\nDue to strong infectivity and high proportion of asymptomatic cases, the cluster COVID-19 transmission becomes a difficult containment issue. In some regions, the number of cases related to the cluster transmission can reach 50%–80% of the total cases ( Gopinath, 2020 ). At present, cluster cases of COVID-19 have been reported in relatively confined or congregated places such as shopping malls, offices, buses, cruises, prisons, hospitals, and nursing homes. Ong et al. found that the detection results of samples collected at the hospital air outlet were positive, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 could pollute the environment through the droplet of patients ( Ong et al., 2020 ). Wu et al. investigated the cluster epidemic situation of a department store and found that the close distance between the salesman and the customer was easy to cause respiratory transmission when talking ( Wu et al., 2020b ). It is also reported that several senior officials in some countries were diagnosed as COVID-19 cases, which might be related to participation of public gatherings such as parliamentary meetings, receptions and commemorative activities without wearing masks. Cases who come into contact with a large number of individuals through work or socially may become “super-spreaders” if they do not exercise preventive measures.\n\nAnother important feature of the COVID-19 is that asymptomatic cases proportion is high. It is estimated approximately 60% of all infections convert from cases with mild symptom or asymptotic cases and might be passing the virus on to others ( Qiu, 2020 ). Of the confirmed cases in Diamond Princess cruise ship, approximately 17.9% of infected people never developed symptoms, leading to high attack rate among cruise ship passengers and crew ( Mizumoto et al., 2020 ). This proportion echoes with the finding of an epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 close contacts in Ningbo, China that 16.7% of infected cases were asymptomatic ( Chen et al., 2020 ). The proportion of asymptomatic cases was estimated to be 16.38% and 27.56% in Hubei and other provinces in China, respectively (data from China CDC). The transmission rate of undocumented infections, those who undergo mild, limited, or no symptoms and hence go unrecognized, was 55% of documented infections (46%–62%) due to high quantity, and undocumented infections were the infection source of 79% of documented cases ( Li et al., 2020 ), leading to a great public health threat.\n\nMain transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 include droplet and contact transmissions, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which aerosol generating procedures (AGP) are performed ( World Health Organization, 2020c ). Although the virus nucleic acid could be detected in fecal specimens, there has been no public reports on fecal-oral transmission yet ( Xie et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020a ).

        "full_text": "Study design\n\nParticipants were recruited year-round from March 2013 through May 2016 in a general outpatient clinic of a private hospital in Hong Kong. As routine practice, clinic staff screened all individuals attending the clinics for respiratory and any other symptoms regardless of the purpose of the visit at triage. Study staff then approached immediately those who reported at least one of the following symptoms of ARI for further screening: fever ≥37.8 °C, cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache, myalgia and phlegm. Individuals who reported ≥2 ARI symptoms, within 3 d of illness onset and ≥11 years of age were eligible to participate. After explaining the study to and obtaining informed consent from the participants, a rapid influenza diagnostic test, the Sofia Influenza A + B Fluorescent Immunoassay Analyzer (cat. no. 20218, Quidel), was used to identify influenza A or B virus infection as an incentive to participate. All participants provided a nasal swab for the rapid test and an additional nasal swab and a separate throat swab for subsequent virologic confirmation at the laboratory. All participants also completed a questionnaire to record basic information including age, sex, symptom severity, medication, medical conditions and smoking history. In the first phase of the study from March 2013 to February 2014 (‘Influenza Study’), the result of the rapid test was used to determine eligibility for further participation in the study and exhaled breath collection, whereas in the second phase of the study from March 2014 to May 2016 (‘Respiratory Virus Study’), the rapid test did not affect eligibility. Eligible participants were then invited to provide an exhaled breath sample for 30 min in the same clinic visit.\n\nBefore exhaled breath collection, each participant was randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either wearing a surgical face mask (cat. no. 62356, Kimberly-Clark) or not during the collection. To mimic the real-life situation, under observation by the study staff, participants were asked to attach the surgical mask themselves, but instruction on how to wear the mask properly was given when the participant wore the mask incorrectly. Participants were instructed to breathe as normal during the collection, but (natural) coughing was allowed and the number of coughs was recorded by study staff. Participants were then invited to provide a second exhaled breath sample of the alternate type (for example if the participant was first assigned to wearing a mask they would then provide a second sample without a mask), but most participants did not agree to stay for a second measurement because of time constraints. Participants were compensated for each 30-min exhaled breath collection with a supermarket coupon worth approximately US$30 and all participants were gifted a tympanic thermometer worth approximately US$20.\n\nEthical approval\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all participants ≥18 years of age and written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of participants 11–17 years of age in addition to their own written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong and the Clinical and Research Ethics Committee of Hong Kong Baptist Hospital.\n\nCollection of swabs and exhaled breath particles\n\nNasal swabs and throat swabs were collected separately, placed in virus transport medium, stored and transported to the laboratory at 2–8 °C and the virus transport medium was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until further analysis. Exhaled breath particles were captured and differentiated into two size fractions, the coarse fraction containing particles with aerodynamic diameter >5 μm (referred to here as ‘respiratory droplets’), which included droplets up to approximately 100 µm in diameter and the fine fraction with particles ≤5 μm (referred to here as ‘aerosols’) by the G-II bioaerosol collecting device12,15,19. In the G-II device, exhaled breath coarse particles >5 μm were collected by a 5-μm slit inertial Teflon impactor and the remaining fine particles ≤5 μm were condensed and collected into approximately 170 ml of 0.1% BSA/PBS. Both the impactor and the condensate were stored and transported to the laboratory at 2–8 °C. The virus on the impactor was recovered into 1 ml and the condensate was concentrated into 2 ml of 0.1% BSA/PBS, aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until further analysis. In a validation study, the G-II was able to recover over 85% of fine particles >0.05 µm in size and had comparable collection efficiency of influenza virus as the SKC BioSampler19.\n\nLaboratory testing\n\nSamples collected from the two studies were tested at the same time. Nasal swab samples were first tested by a diagnostic-use viral panel, xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (Abbott Molecular) to qualitatively detect 12 common respiratory viruses and subtypes including coronaviruses (NL63, OC43, 229E and HKU1), influenza A (nonspecific, H1"

        "full_text": "Abstract The need for proven disease-specific treatments for the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 necessitates a worldwide search for therapeutic options. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus shares extensive homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, effective therapies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may also have therapeutic potential for the current COVID-19 outbreak. To identify therapeutics that might be repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistic and in vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19. Therapeutics with particularly high potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a severe cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma and humanized monoclonal antibodies offer passive immunity and decreased recovery time. This review highlights potential therapeutic options that may be repurposed to treat COVID-19 and suggests opportunities for further research. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, coronavirus, repositioning, repurposing, treatment, therapeutics\n\n1. Introduction The new pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to the Coronaviridae family [1]. The Coronaviridae family is a cohort of viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes that typically cause both respiratory and enteric diseases [2]. The three coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory illnesses, known as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, respectively. The current pandemic COVID-19 is a primarily respiratory disease with a spectrum of severity ranging from mild upper respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and ultimately death [3]. The three coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 all belong to the betacoronavirus genus [3]. Sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome shows that it is 82% identical to that of SARS-CoV [1], whereas MERS-CoV shares approximately 50% genomic sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 [4]. While these three viruses are zoonotic in origin, the spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was generally limited to nosocomial and intra-family transmission, whereas SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly and has achieved widespread community transmission. Each of these three coronaviruses causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans. In 2003, a SARS-CoV outbreak started in China and caused 8,098 confirmed cases worldwide with 775 fatalities [2]. In 2012, the MERS-CoV outbreak that emerged in Saudi Arabia caused 22,260 confirmed cases with 803 fatalities [2]. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in China in late 2019 and has caused over 10,000,000 human cases and more than 500,000 fatalities as of June 29th, 2020 [5,6]. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has far surpassed that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in magnitude, with the number of cases and deaths increasing daily. Given the lack of vaccines or specific treatments for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to identify therapeutic options to both limit the replication of this virus and prevent further spread. Based on the extensive homology shared by SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, we hypothesize that drugs with evidence of benefit in treatment of SARS or MERS are likely to benefit patients with COVID-19. This review summarizes drugs and therapies with either theoretical, in vitro, or in vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV to strategically identify therapeutic options that can be used or repurposed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n2. Materials and Methods PubMed, CINAHL, EMBase, and Google Scholar were searched to identify articles that supported therapeutic benefit for a pharmacological substance in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV that could be repositioned for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Four of the authors conducted independent searches to evaluate various search strategies. These combined strategies were shared and optimized with the Prisma Health System staff medical librarians. The aggregate search strategy includes articles limited to those available prior to June 15, 2020. Search"

Presently, data on the real-world effectiveness and optimal dosage of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 are limited. We conducted a retrospective observational study of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 at five tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. We reviewed patient charts to obtain all necessary data. Among 247 COVID-19 patients, 63 (23.0%) received ≥1 dose of favipiravir. Of these 63 patients, 61.9% were male with a median age of 48 years (range 22-85 years), 27.0% required an O 2 nasal cannula, 9.5% required non-invasive ventilation and/or high-flow O 2 therapy, and 6.4% required invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO. The median baseline NEWS2 score was 5 (0-16). The Day-7 clinical improvement rate [95%CI] was 66.7% [53.7-78.0%] in all patients, 92.5% [75.7-99.1%] in patients who did not require O 2 supplementation, and 47.2% [0.4-64.5%] in patients who required O 2 supplementation. No life-threatening adverse events were identified. The 28-day mortality rate was 4.8%. A multivariate analysis revealed three poor prognostic factors for Day-7 clinical improvement (odds ratio (95%CI); p-value): older age (0.94 (0.89-0.99); p = 0.04), a higher baseline NEWS2 score (0.64 (0.47-0.88); p = 0.006), and a lower favipiravir loading dose (≤45 mg/kg/day) (0.04 (0.005-0.4); p = 0.006). In conclusion, our study reports the promising effectiveness of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 patients. In addition to older age and a high baseline NEWS2 score, a low loading dose of favipiravir (≤45 mg/kg/day) was also identified as a poor prognostic factor for early clinical improvement. Further studies to explore the optimal dose and the optimal timing of drug initiation for favipiravir should be performed."

        "full_text": "Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a fatal and fast-spreading viral infection. To date, the number of COVID-19 patients worldwide has crossed over six million with over three hundred and seventy thousand deaths (according to the data from World Health Organization; updated on 2 June 2020). Although COVID-19 can be rapidly diagnosed, efficient clinical treatment of COVID-19 remains unavailable, resulting in high fatality. Some clinical trials have identified vitamin C (VC) as a potent compound pneumonia management. In addition, glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is clinically as an anti-inflammatory medicine against pneumonia-induced inflammatory stress. We hypothesized that the combination of VC and GA is a potential option for treating COVID-19.\n\nMethods: The aim of this study was to determine pharmacological targets and molecular mechanisms of VC + GA treatment for COVID-19, using bioinformational network pharmacology.\n\nResults: We uncovered optimal targets, biological processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of VC + GA against COVID-19. Our findings suggested that combinatorial VC and GA treatment for COVID-19 was associated with elevation of immunity and suppression of inflammatory stress, including activation of the T cell receptor signaling pathway, regulation of Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, ErbB signaling pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. We also identified 17 core targets of VC + GA, which suggest as antimicrobial function.\n\nConclusions: For the first time, our study uncovered the pharmacological mechanism underlying combined VC and GA treatment for COVID-19. These results should benefit efforts to address the most pressing problem currently facing the world."

We reviewed the feasibility of using vitamin C in the setting of COVID-19 in a series of patients. Methods We sequentially identified a series of patients who were requiring at least 30% of FiO2 or more who received IV vitamin C as part of the COVID-19 treatment and analyzed their demographic and clinical characteristics. We compared inflammatory markers pre and post treatment including D-dimer and ferritin. Results We identified a total of 17 patients who received IV vitamin C for COVID-19. The inpatient mortality rate in this series was 12% with 17.6% rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation. We noted a significant decrease in inflammatory markers, including ferritin and D-dimer, and a trend to decreasing FiO2 requirements, after vitamin C administration.

Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected almost 2.5 million people worldwide with almost 170,000 deaths reported to date [1]. Patients present with a wide range of disease severity and certain comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, immunosuppression, and age have been associated with high morbidity and mortality [2]. There are no treatments with strong evidence of clinical benefit, and national and international guidelines recommend using experimental drugs as part of investigational trials [3–5]. There is growing evidence on the potential benefit of vitamin supplementation for prevention and treatment of viral infections, especially in vitamin-deficient population [6]. Vitamin C is essential for a normal and well-functional host defense mechanism, and pharmacological application of vitamin C is believed to enhance immune function [7]. Previous studies have shown that vitamin C inhibited replication of some viruses such as herpes simplex virus, poliovirus, and influenza [7]. There is potential utility in the use of vitamin C in viral infections and possibly COVID-19. Here, we describe a small case series of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 who received low to moderate doses of intravenous vitamin C in addition to common treatments for COVID-19.\n\n2. Methods We sequentially identified 17 patients confirmed to be Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive via single-test nasopharyngeal swab PCR who were requiring 30% or more fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and who received IV vitamin C as part of the COVID-19 treatment. Patients were treated in the progressive care unit and medical intensive care unit of Albert Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA (USA). There was no age cutoff or exclusion criteria used. Patients were either on hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, and/or tocilizumab as part of initial treatment for COVID-19. These were given regardless of vitamin C administration depending on the clinical prerogative of the treating physician. Doses of these medications were not standardized as there was no strong evidence for their use. Vitamin C was administered at a dose of 1 g every 8 h for 3 days. Baseline inflammatory markers such as D-dimer and ferritin were also obtained by chart review and compared before and after administration of the vitamin C regimen. Outcomes such as inpatient mortality and need for mechanical ventilation were also obtained. No formal ethical approval was secured as these medications were relatively safe and already part of the hospital formulary. Off label use of vitamin C however was subject to the usual informed patient consent citing the risks and potential unknown benefits. All patients received care based on the clinical decisions of treating physicians; formal ethical approval from hospital Institutional Review Board was not required. 2.1. Statistical analysis Categorical data were summarized using frequency percentages. Continuous variables were presented as means. Paired T-tests were used to compare D dimer, Ferritin, and mean FiO2% pre and post vitamin C administration. Chi square was used to compare rates of inpatient mortality and need for mechanical ventilation among patients who took hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, and tocilizumab.\n\n3. Results The mean age of patients in our series was 64 ± 14 years; 41% were females and the majority were African Americans (59%). Mean BMI (Body Mass Index) was 32.7, indicative of high prevalence of obesity. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were present in 47%, while COPD and asthma in 24% of patients, respectively (see Table 1). The patients were started on vitamin C tre"

Therefore, preventive health measures that can reduce the risk of infection, progression and severity are desperately needed. This review discussed the possible roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory tract infections and severity. Moreover, this study determined the correlation of vitamin D levels with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 20 European countries as of 20 May 2020. A significant negative correlation (p=0.033) has been observed between mean vitamin D levels and COVID-19 cases per one million population in European countries. However, the correlation of vitamin D with COVID-19 deaths of these countries was not significant. Some retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find the correlation when confounding variables are adjusted. Several studies demonstrated the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. These include direct inhibition with viral replication or with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory ways. In the meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation has been shown as safe and effective against acute respiratory tract infections. Thus, people who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency during this global pandemic should consider taking vitamin D supplements to maintain the circulating 25(OH)D in the optimal levels (75-125nmol/L). In conclusion, there is not enough evidence on the association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity and mortality. Therefore, randomized control trials and cohort studies are necessary to test this hypothesis."

Lopinavir inhibits the division of HIV Gag-Pol, whilst Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor. The combination of the two molecules reduces the replication of HIV by the production of immature particles that block viral replication [14]. LPV/r attaches in vitro to SARS-Cov-1 and, considering the high homology sequences between SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2, LPV/r is currently employed in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. During the SARS epidemic of 2004, Chu et al. [15] reported the utilization of LPV/r in addiction to Ribavirin showing a significative lower risk of adverse events such as ARDS or death compared to patients treated with Ribavirin only. LPV/r should be administered in the first 7–10 d, during the peak phase of the virus replication [16]. Data about the efficacy of LPV/r mostly come from small case series and retrospective, cohort studies [17,18]. Regarding pregnancy, there are no data available on the effects of LPV/r in the treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19. The available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of this drug during pregnancy derives from studies on the treatment of HIV-positive pregnant women. A randomized controlled trial by Koss et al. [19] involved 356 pregnant women infected with HIV, showing no significant risk of preterm labor, even if Berghella [20] reported that it crosses the transplacental barrier and may increase the risk of preterm delivery, but not the risk of teratogenic effects. These evidences seem to be confirmed also by Roberts et al. [21], in a study where 955 women with exposure to LPV/r during pregnancy were analyzed. LPV/r are not assigned to any FDA category, while ritonavir alone is classified in B category. For relative safety, LPV/r is a possible therapeutic option in pregnant women with COVID-19. A treatment protocol could involve an oral administration of LPV/r 200 mg/50 mg, two capsules every 12 h with alfa-interferon 5 million IU in 2 ml of nebulized physiologic solution [22]. Kim et al.[23] on the contrary recommend to avoid the nebulization of solutions for the risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 and, when possible, to administer inhaled medications by metered dose inhaler. If the nebulized therapy is necessary, it is important to use some precautions during the nebulization, such as the positioning of the patient in an airborne infection isolation room, the use of adequate PPE and not to reenter the room for 2–3 h after the therapy [24]. Side effects of this therapy are anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, gastritis, liver and renal damage, pancreatitis, cutaneous manifestation [25,26] and hepatotoxicity, which is of particular importance considering that 20–30% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 have transaminase elevation [27]. Remdesivir (formally known as GS-5734), is a new nucleoside analog which appears to have promising antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA virus such as SARS/MERS-CoV and also against Ebola virus infection [26]. Currently, remdesivir could represent a promising therapy for COVID-19 due to its broad spectrum and it has demonstrated an in vitro activity against several novel CoronaVirus (nCOV), including SARS-CoV-2 [28,29]. Remdesivir acts by inhibiting RNA dependent RNA polymerase by reducing viral replication within the host cells and improving MERS/CoV induced lung damage as demonstrated in non-human primates. Remdesivir reduced the severity of disease, virus replication and damage to the lungs when administered as pre-exposure prophylaxis and therapeutic treatment in rhesus macaques [30,31]. Phase 3 clinical trials are now ongoing to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of remdesivir in patients with mild to moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in United States and China [32] and it seems to be safe for the use in human pregnancies, as shown in trials conducted in Ebola and Marburg virus disease [33]. Early data from a randomized, placebo-controlled study by National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that remdesivir helps to accelerates the time to recovery in severely ill patients with COVID-19. This trial showed that recovery was reduced from 15 to 11 d. Results included 1,063 patients from 68 sites (47 in the United States and 21 in European and Asian countries) are still awaiting a peer review. On 1st May 2020, few days after early data of the remdesivir trials were released by NIH, the FDA approved the emergency use (EUA) of the remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease [34]. Prior to this authorization the use was approved only in the context of compassionate use protocols (child < 18 years and pregnant women) or in subjects enrolled in clinical trials [16], therefore it is not classified in any FDA toxicity category. The dosage currently proposed is a single iv 200-mg loading dose, followed"

        "full_text": "In the absence of definitive and specific treatment regimens, strategies including early diagnosis, timely reporting, isolation, and supportive treatments are important line of actions against COVID-19 infections. Current social practices including timely release of epidemic information and maintenance of social orders and personal practices such as improving personal hygiene, wearing facial coverings or masks, adequate rest, and keeping rooms well ventilated remain some of first line of actions against COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAt present, the treatments of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are mainly repurposing the available therapeutic drugs and based on symptomatic conditions. Considering ARDS, followed by secondary infections, antibiotics, antiviral therapy, systemic corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs (including anti-arthritis drugs) are often used in the treatment regimens. In addition to antiviral interferers and antibiotics, neuraminidase inhibitors, RNA synthesis inhibitors, convalescent plasma, and traditional herbal medicines have also been utilized in the treatment of COVID-19 [27]. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these treatment regimens remains to be verified by appropriately designed clinical trials.\n\nOseltamivir(branded as Tamiflu) is a drug approved for treatment of influenza A and B. Oseltamivir targets the neuraminidase distributed on the surface of the influenza virus to inhibit the spread of the influenza virus in the human body [ 63 , 64 ]. A study in Wuhan reported that no positive outcomes were observed after receiving antiviral treatment with oseltamivir [ 65 ]. Several clinical trials are still evaluating the effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Oseltamivir is also used in clinical trials in several combinations, such as with chloroquine and favipiravir [ 66 ].\n\nFavipiravir (branded as Avigan) has been developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical in 2014 in Japan for the treatment of avian influenza or novel influenza resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors. It is a guanine analogue with pyrazinecarboxamide structure, and its antiviral activity is decreased at the presence of purine nucleosides due to the competition [ 60 ]. The prodrug favipiravir first enters the infected cells through endocytosis and is then transformed into active favipiravir ribofuranosyl phosphates through phosphoribosylation and phosphorylation [ 60 , 61 ]. The antiviral activity is exhibited through selectively targeting conservative catalytic domain of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), interrupting the nucleotide incorporation process during viral RNA replication [ 60 ]. The dysregulation in viral RNA replication results in increased number and frequency of transition mutations including replacement of guanine (G) by adenine (A) and cytosine (C) by thymine (T) or C by Uracil (U) which induces destructive mutagenesis in RNA viruses [ 60 ]. Favipiravir has been used in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by RNA viruses such as influenza, Ebola, and norovirus [ 62 ]. Recent in vitro and human studies have repurposed favipiravir as an experimental agent against enveloped, positive-sense, single-strand RNA virus SARS-CoV-2. An in vitro research has investigated seven potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 medicines including ribavirin, penciclovir, favipiravir, nafamostat, nitazoxanide, remdesivir, and chloroquine, showing that remdesivir and chloroquine have favorable selectivity index [ 30 ]. In addition, the study showed favipiravir has exerted efficacy in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 61.88 μM and half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) at over 400 μM, implying the high concentration is needed for safe and effective treatment [ 30 ]. Clinical trials testing favipiravir against COVID-19 have been carried out vigorously in various countries including China and Japan. A randomized control trial (ChiCTR200030254) has shown that COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir have superior recovery rate (71.43%) than that treated with umifenovir (55.86%), and the duration of fever and cough relief time are significantly shorter in favipiravir group than in umifenovir group [ 59 ]. Up to mid-April 2020, there are eight undergoing clinical trials in China and two in Japan examining the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of favipiravir. These trials include non-randomized and randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of favipiravir alone (ChiCTR2000030113, JPRN-jRCTs031190226, JPRN-jRCTs041190120) or in conjunction with interferon-α (ChiCTR2000029600), baloxavir marboxil (ChiCTR2000029544, ChiCTR2000029548), tocilizumab (ChiCTR2000030894, NCT04310228 ), or chloroquine phosphate (ChiCTR2000030987, NCT04319900 ).\n\nUmifenovir (branded as Arbidol), a derivative of indole carboxylic acids, was first developed in 1988 in Russia and has since been approved in Russia and China for treating prophylaxis and infections associated with influenz"
